# SWAG Pascal Code Collection (DelphiDabbler Edition)
#
# Build tool to package up files ready for release.

#
#
# A single package is made that contains the SWAG collection itself along with
# documentation and license information. Everything is packaged into a single
# zip file. The zip file is written to the '_release' directory.
#
# Any pre-existing '_release' directory is cleared before the zip file is
# created.
#
# Requirements:
#
#   - The release version number must be passed to this script on the command
#     line. The version number must be in x.y.z format where x, y and z
#     represent the major, minor and patch version numbers respectively.
#
#   - The Info-ZIP zip utility is required to zip up the files. Make sure it's
#     on the system path.
#

# Simple minded check that some value has been passed as 1st paramter
