# SWAG Pascal Code Collection (DelphiDabbler Edition)
#
# Build tool to package up files ready for release.

#
#
# A single package is created that contains the SWAG collection itself along
# with documentation and license information. Everything is packaged into a
# zip file that is written to the '_release' directory. For details of the
# package contents see the project's 'README.md' file.
#
# ** WARNING: Any pre-existing '_release' directory is cleared before the zip
#   file is created.
#
# Requirements:
#
#   - See the project's 'README.md' file for details of the utilities required
#     to run this script.
#
#   - The version number included in the generated zip file name is taken from
#     the 'VERSION' file in the project's 'source' directory. Ensure this file
#     is updated to the correct version before running the script. The script
#     will fail if 'VERSION' is missing or is invalid. Read the file
#     'swag-data-structure.md' in the project's 'docs' directory for more
#     information about the 'VERSION' file.
