     Well, Here's some of my code.. It does a pretty good job of  imitating a
ball bouncing, but one of the bounces goes higher than  the other.. Haven't
really had time to look into it. Hopefully you  have TheDraw because I made
the program such that you have to save  your ANSI as a normal Pascal file in
The Draw and then cut and  paste it into the program. Hope this helps!

{Right here you place all the ANSI data from TheDraw.. When I tried, I just
 saved my picture in The Draw as a Normal pascal file and used the
 default identifier. THen I cut and pasted!                        }
