Sadly, the 3d.zip file was corrupt again.  Please use my programs here and
generate a DATA.HEX include file.  Your post had lines that were uneven and
obviously missing data.  An include file made by ZIP2HEX will be even and
verifiable.  HEX2ZIP will create the original binary file renamed BINARY.ZIP.
I noticed your zip file was less than 20k and its source code contents were
over 100k.  The include file will always be four times the size of the zip due
to formatting with commas and dollar symbols.  A smarter version should use
LONGINTS instead of BYTES to gain a 60% savings.
