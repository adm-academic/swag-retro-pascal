You can check signatures. Strings at certain offsets give them away. From
my BBS program, I can tell you some.

Each starts at an offset and then has a string. These offsets and strings

ARC: 0,1a
ZIP: 0,504b0304 (old)
LH113: 2,2d6c68
LHarc: 2,2d6c68
ZOO: 0,5a4f4f
ARJ: 0,60ea

Use var f:file. Reset(f,1). Seek(f,offset). Blockread(f,somevar,bytecount).
