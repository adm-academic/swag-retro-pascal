This has been reputed to work. Although I didn't write it (Salim Samhara
I think is who did) and if I did I would have changed it to load ax and
bx as one unit instead of ah and al, then bh and bl. With this though
you have to have the buffer in the data segment, not on the stack.

So here's how I would do it:
}

Procedure LoadFont (FileName : String);
Type
 FontType=Array [char] of Array [0..15] of Byte;
Var
 F    : File of FontType;
 Font : FontType;
Begin
 Assign (F, FileName);
 Reset (F);
 Read (F,Font);
 Close (F);
 Asm
  mov ax,$1100
  mov bx,$1000
  mov cx,$0100
  xor dx,dx
  mov es,seg Font
  mov bp,offset Font
  Int $10
  end;
 End;
