program Reverse;

{
  Sample program demonstrating manipulation of the VGA (EGA?)
  alphanumeric character set using the 80x25 character mode.

  The only thing this program does is to copy the current character
  set from the video adapter, and restore it in such a way that all
  the characters appear upside-down.  To restore the characters,
  simply run the program again.  Not that this is a terribly useful
  thing to do, mind you...

  NOTE: This has not been tested on monochrome monitors or in
        other video modes.

  Written using Borland Pascal 7.0.

  For more information on character sets for other video modes and
  a whole bunch of good stuff on the EGA & VGA in general, you will
  want the following book:

      Characters are stored in a 8x32 pixel matrix, allowing
      for characters that are 32 scan lines high.  Each byte
      in the buffer represents one scan line of a single
      character.  In the 80x25 character mode only the first
      16 scan lines are displayed, so we need to be a little
      careful about what bytes are swapped. }
