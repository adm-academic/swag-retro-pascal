This is another BAsm I've written to optimize my Program. Some of the
comma-delimited fields have the Underscore Character in the place of Spaces. It
is desirable For them to be replaced For use in my Program.

BeFore writing this Procedure I was using:

Procedure Kill_(Var Strng : String);
Repeat
  Subpos := Pos('_',String);
  if subpos > 0
     then Strng[subpos] := ' ';
Until Killpos Subpos = 0;
end;

This was getting called approx 250,000 times in my project, and Turbo ProFiler
practically waved a red flag at me about it!  <grin>

This is my new Procedure which screams as Compared to the previous routine.

I am using TP 6.0 Professional.

Does anyone more knowledgable in Assembly than I am have any suggestions For
this Procedure?   I Realize I am working With the original copy of the String
with this Procedure, and modifying it to boot, but I am saving the time to copy
it to/from the stack when I am making the changes.    My Program doES take this
into account, and ONLY passes Strings to the procedure.
