    Foreground := TextAttr and $0f;
    Background := (TextAttr and $f0) shr 4;

{A few days ago, I read a message from someone who was trying to extract
foreground and background colors from one Byte Variable. I have since
lost the mail packet, and forgotten the user's name, but here's a
routine that will do that anyways. Hope it gets to the person who was
asking For it......

Procedure GetColors(Color : Byte; Var BackGr : Byte; Var ForeGr : Byte);
begin
  BackGr := Color shr 4;
  ForeGr := Color xor (Background shl 4);
end;
