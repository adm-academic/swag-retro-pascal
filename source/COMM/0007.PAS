  Gareth,
  I didn't see any replies to your message, but I've been looking
  For the same inFormation myself.  I saw the following code, based
  on a message from Norbert Igl, last year.  When I dial my own
  phone number, it gives me a busy signal For a second or two, and
  then hangs up.  I don't know what makes the busy signal stop.  and
  I don't know how to receive the modem String "BUSY" or "NO CARRIER"
  or "NO DIALtoNE".

  I noticed in my modem manual that modem command X4 will
  generate the following responses:

  Number Response       Word Response
  (V0 command)           (V1 command)

     6                      NO DIALtoNE
     7                      BUSY
     8                      NO ANSWER
                            (The modem responds With 8 if you send
                            the @ command [Wait For Quiet Answer],
                            and it didn't subsequently detect 5
                            seconds of silence.)

     I wish I could figure out a way to "capture" the response, either the
     number (say, 7) or the Word ('BUSY').  if I could detect a busy
     signal, I could then create a loop that would make the
     Program continually redial if it detected busy signals.

     if you figure it out, could you post your solution?
