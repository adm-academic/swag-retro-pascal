-> Currently I am writing the USERS File to a  Temp File While im
-> reading it (or atleast I try to), but pascal  does not allow
-> me to Write a full Record to a File.

I suppose you're running a on a network, and that you have
problems accessing the USERS File directly?

First of all, do you open the File in shared mode, which is
necessary if multiple Programs to access the File simultaneous.

-> So could you  tell me an easier way Write back the
-> modifications that I have  done. A little example would be
-> Really cool..

Sure... Here's a little example. Tested With PCBoard configured
for use on network, With DESQview.

if you'd relly try this you should reWrite the proc "ModifyRecord" first ;)
