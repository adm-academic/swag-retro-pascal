{
I created the following purly from my observations of the Bluewave files that
I have reiceived. There are parts that I believe to be incorrect, such as the
last five variables in the MIXRec record. I have worked very hard on this, so
if you use the following please give me my due creidit in the program or
documentation.

The BBSNAME.FTI file is made up of FTIRec records.

The BBSNAME.INF file is made up of one INFRec record and an unknown number
of ConfRec records.

The BBSNAME.MIX file is made up of an unknown number of MIXRec records.

The BBSNAME.DAT file is a file of char indexed by the FTIRec records.
