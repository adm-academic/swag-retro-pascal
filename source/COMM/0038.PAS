You probably use a very simple way, which doesn't envolves capturing the
modem's Com port IRQ. That's why you use chars over faster transmitions.
To make sure the program will be fast, optimize it to assembler, or at least
use I/O Ports manipulations (If you odn't use it already).
A cut from a source I have here (Design for com1, if you need support for other
ports use a guide such as Helppc. If you want To write Doors for BBSes you
better use Fossil functions, For that either use Fsildoc.??? (It's in several
FTP sites) or Ralf Brown's Interrupt list):
