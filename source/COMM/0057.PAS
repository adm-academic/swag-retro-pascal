True. Here is an excerpt from 'myfos', my fossil interface unit; F_GetDrvID()
will return a string containing the current fossil driver's identification.
Sorry for the sloppy coding, I programmed this thing quite a while ago and
since it worked I never updated it to my current programming skills...
