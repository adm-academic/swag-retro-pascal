³  Post more code so we can see where you're going wrong.

I'm just posting things that are relevant, i.e. no error trapping code
and such. Also I've deleted the original comments, as they are in
Norwegian, and added some new in English.

Also, I use one heck of a stack. The program worked fine on my machine,
I took it a friend and on his machine the default stack was too little.
When I came back the exact same program that I had been using on my
machine also started complaining about the stack size. Could pointers
help in reducing stack?
