{This ASYNC unit implements a >COMPLETE< multi-port serial interface wrapped
 in a turbo pascal object.  Baud rates up to 110,000 are supported.  Up to
 four ports may be opened at a time, up to two ports may be active at any
 given time (four can be active so long as they do not share interrupts).
 Some considerations.  A com port which shares the same interrupt as a
 serial mouse will over-ride the mouse driver for the duration of the
 program.  If you have a mouse on Com1, avoid using Com3 in your program.
 Likewise if you have a mouse on Com2, avoid using Com4 in your program.
 A mouse on a BUS card will not be affected by this unit.  Default addresses
 for the 4 com ports dictate that com1 & com3, and com2 & com4 share an
 interrupt on the system bus.  As such while you can open both ports, make
 sure that only - ONE of the ports on the shared interrupt has been .ENABLED
 at any one time.  See the .ENABLE and .DISABLE procedures for more
 information.}

Type
   {Buf Type is never actually >declared< in this unit.  It is created only
    as a pointer to an area of memory which can actually only be 10 to 64000
    bytes long.  However by creating the pointer in this way, the contents
    of the pointer memory can be accessed like an array of chars simplifying
    the coding of this unit.  If you only create a 10000 byte buffer then
    it's valid to read BUFTYPE[0] through BufTYPE[10000] anything higher
    is dangerous since no memory was set aside for this buffer.  However

{Init is the standard object initialization routine. You must pass the
 comport (1-4) you want the object to be associated with and the buffer
 size (10-64000 bytes) you want the buffer to be.  Init returns the following
 codes based upon it's success or failure......

    0 - Com Port Initialized
    1 - ComPort is out of range - not 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    2 - ComPort is already active and in use.
    3 - Buffer size is either to small (10 bytes or more) or to large
        (greater than 64000) - Recieve Buffer
    4 - Transmit buffer size out of range (See #3)

 Init only sets up the buffers and prepares the interrupt vector.  You must
 follow this with a call to setparams (set baud rate, parity, etc), then
 a call to enable.  See enable and disable especially if you are going to
 use multiple comm ports simultaniously.

Procedure Com_Port.Enable;

{This should be the third command you run after .INIT and .SETPARAM.  Enable
 and Disable are provided for multi-port use.  If you are using com1 and
 com2 together you can leave both ports enabled at the same time, likewise
 with com3 and com4.  However ports that share interrupts (Com1 & Com3)
 (com2 & com4) can not both be enabled at the same time.  This is the reason
 I wrote this unit because the most popular pascal com libraries
 (particularly the async libraries by rising sun which are otherwise
 extrodinarilly compitent packages) could not handle shared interrupts.
 This unit can, but it cheats by allowing you to "suspend" one of the ports
 on the shared interrupt.  While a port is suspended (disabled) you can not
 send or recieve data from that port.  Other considerations - a mouse on
 com1 will not work with this package when you use com3, likewise a mouse
 on com2 will not work when you run com4 this is because this package
