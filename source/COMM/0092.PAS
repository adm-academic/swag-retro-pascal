Heres a simple term program....  no frills except that it writes to dos's
putchar so that it supports ANSI!....     Public domain!

Simple com program by Ira Gardiner....  all from scratch!

uses crt;

Const
  Com = $2f8; {base address of com port}

Procedure Write(w : char);  {Quick and dirty write to Dos's FAST PUTCHAR}
begin                       {It only writes one char though! that's all it's}
                            {supposed to!}
