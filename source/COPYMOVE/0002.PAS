{I've been trying to figure out how to do a fairly fast copy
 in pascal.  It doesn't have to be faster then Dos copy, but
 I definatly DON'T want to shell out to Dos to do it!
 I've got the following working... in the IDE of Turbo 6.0!
 If I compile it, it wont work at all.  ALSO... If you COMP
 the Files to check For errors, They are there.  (UGH!)
 (ie, it isn't a perfect copy!)
 The thing is I want to get as much as I can in each pass!
 (But turbo has limits!)
 Heres my code... Just rough, so no Real comments.

You don't close the input- and output File when your finished With the
first count passes. Maybe your last block will not be written to disk,
when you reopen the outputFile For writing. I can't see another problem
right now.
