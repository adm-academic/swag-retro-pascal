Here's something that I have in my tool box that may help you out. }

PROCEDURE WriteC80_25(S, Fore, Back, Blink : Byte);
{ This procedure will write a single character to the 80th column,
  25th row of the screen without scrolling it on a color monitor }

BEGIN
   Mem[$B800:3998] := S;
   Mem[$B800:3999] := Blink + (Back SHL 4) + Fore;
END; { WriteC80_25 }

PROCEDURE WriteM80_25(S, Fore, Back, Blink : Byte);
{ This procedure will write a single character to the 80th column,
  25th row of the screen without scrolling it on a Mono monitor }

BEGIN
   Mem[$B000:3998] := Ord(S);
   Mem[$B000:3999] := Blink + (Back SHL 4) + Fore;
END; { WriteM80_25 }

What I would do in your case is I would call the appropriate procedure
for the last character that you write to the screen in your Draw_Window
routine.

Hope that helps you!
