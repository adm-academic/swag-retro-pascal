 Does anyone have a routine, or more, that will change video mode, 25
 to 43/50 lines, or back WITHOUT clearing the screen as TextMode does?
 I "hate" that <g>, I know OpCrt is supposed to do that, but I cannot
 use OpCrt in this program without doing MAJOR changes to about 20
 other units that use Tp.Crt. I will, but later, fix that, but for now
 could use a routine of this nature.... }

   MOV AX,$1112
   INT $10

   MOV AX,$1114
   INT $10
