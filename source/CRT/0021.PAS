Unit CrtSeg;
{
  CRTSEG.TPU - Written by Tom Donnelly and placed into the public domain.

               Allow the video segment address in CRT.TPU
               to be overridden with a different address.
               Particularly useful under DesqView, to make
               Turbo Pascal programs more DesqView compliant.

  Example:     SetCrtSeg(Desqview_video_buffer);

  This unit has only been tested under Turbo Pascal 6.  It may or may not
  work under different TP versions.  It is distributed "as is" without any
  claims or warranties expressed or implied.  Use at your own risk.

  If anyone finds a problem with this code, I'd appreciate hearing about it.
