
rogram DirectW;
{
  This program shows how to write directly to video memory.
  It will not work in protected mode. There is no reason
  to believe that this runs any faster than the CRT's
  Write procedure, but we're putting it out on the BBS in
  case you are interested.

  As always, this program comes with no guarrantees and even
  less support.
