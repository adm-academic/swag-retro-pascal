  ...Yes, but try building something like this:
}
Uses
  Crt;

Type
  ar_64K   = Array[1..65521] of Byte;
  po_ar64K = ^ar_64K;
  ar_Po64K = Array[1..200] of po_ar64K;

Var
  by_Index : Byte;
  Buffer   : ar_Po64K;

begin
  ClrScr;
  by_Index := 0;
  While (MaxAvail > SizeOf(ar_64K)) do
  begin
    Inc(by_Index);
    New(Buffer[by_Index]);
    GotoXY(1,1);
    ClrEol;
    Write('Maximum Memory Available: ', MaxAvail);
    Delay(300);
  end;
end.

  ...Using the DPMI HEAP (and calling the correct DPMI Function
  to use your hard disk as virtual memory, unless you do have
  16Mb in your PC) you can allocate all 200 64K chunks of memory.
  With the "Real mode" HEAP, you'd be lucky to be able to allocate
  9 of these 64K chunks.

  ...It also means that you can use this DPMI HEAP to run HUGE .EXE's,
  as it can be used For either CODE or DATA. So you can forget about
  overlays, as you won't need them anymore.
