 Yes.  There is more than one way to do this, using Turbo Pascal.

 The most familiar way is by using the "Type-transfer" Functions:

            orD()           { transfer Char value to Word|Integer   }
            CHR()           { transfer Word|Integer to Char         "

 Similar to this, there is also "Type-casting."  to use this method
 you just put the Variable to be changed inside of brackets that
 specify the Type wanted (see example below).

 A third way is to use "free unions," which look like Records. Again,
 the example code, below, is the best way to show you.

 Experiment With this example code.  if you still have problems
 after, show me an example of what you are trying to do ...
