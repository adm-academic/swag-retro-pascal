Here's how:
}

{$R-} { <-- essential For this trick }

Type
  tFlexArray = Array[1..1] of Integer;

Var
  pFlexArray : ^tFlexArray;
  NumofElements,i : Integer;

begin
  Write('How many elements do you want in the Array?  ');
  readln(NumofElements);
  getmem(pFlexArray, (NumofElements * sizeof(Integer)));
  For i := 1 to NumofElements do
    pFlexArray^[i] := i;

  Write('Test which element?  (Will contain same value as index)  ');
  readln(i);
  Writeln('Element ',i,' contains ',pFlexArray^[i]);
end.
