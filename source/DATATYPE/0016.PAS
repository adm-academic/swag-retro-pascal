In a running program, variables are not really accessed by name, but by
address,  and their names don't show up in the final EXE.  The only way
I know to do such a thing is to add:
*)

Const
  Red    = 1;
  Purple = 5;
  InvOrd : Array [Red..Purple] of String[6] =
      ('Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Violet', 'Purple');

{ And then access this array like: }
begin
  WriteLn('Inverse of Ord of Red:', InvOrd[Red]);
end.
