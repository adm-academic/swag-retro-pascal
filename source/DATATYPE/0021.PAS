  Demonstrate two methods to shuffle cards.  Swap method is fast!
  Demonstrate how to evaluate Bridge hands:
    Each hand of 13 cards are arranged by suits and rank within suit (aces are
    high).  The hand is then evaluated using the following standard bridge
    values.

   Aces count 4
   Kings count 3
   Queens count 2
   Jacks count 1
   Voids (no cards in a suit) count 3
   Singletons (one card in a suit) count 2
   Doubletons (two cards in a suit) count 1
   Long suits with more than five cards in the suit
      count 1 for each card over five in number

   Example: 2C QD TC AD 6C 3D TD 3H 5H 7H AS JH KH = 16 points
   because there are 2 aces, 1 king, 1 queen, 1 jack, 1 singleton.
