{
The following is result of my work to make simple, fast, and enough
acceptable routine that will encrypt/decrypt any data with the given Key
string. It really works, it's far from RSA and DES, but it encrypts/decrypts
just as it will be _quite_ (impossibel? hard?) to restore the original data
without knowing a Key. BTW, i would recommend as long Key as possibel. ;)

This Eigus Encryption released to Public Domain, and no charge is required
for the author. Alsow, if you would have reccomendations, suggestions, ideas,
or stories to optimise my code, please do not hestitate to ask/tell/post.

Eigus Encryption may be included in SWAG. Thank you.

I hope that my CRYPTO unit might be useful for all of you. You may change my
code as you want.
