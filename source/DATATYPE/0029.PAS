Well, the thing with untyped (and typed, only not text) files is that appending
is so easy (once you know), there isn't a procedure for, it's just seeking to
the end of the file.So you just open the textfile as binary file, and seek to
the end of file.

Example (untested):
}

var
 F:file;
begin
 assign(F,'textfile.txt');
 reset(F,1);
 Seek(F,FileSize(F));
 BlockWrite(F,Data,SizeOf(Data))
 Close(F);
end.
{
And Data is appended to the textfile.


I don't think you need to following, but now I'm writing in this echo anyway, I
like to share the it.I made something to seek in a textfile, i.e. if you know
the offset of a line (not the linenumber), it's possible to seek directly to
it, without reading all the lines before it first. TP doesn't allow this, but
with typecasting I got it working. Maybe someone is interested...
