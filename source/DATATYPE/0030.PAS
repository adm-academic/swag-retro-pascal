You can never move 64KB in a single REP MOVSx instruction.
First, the MOVSx instructions only update the offsets, not the
segment registers, so 64KB is a maximu. Second, you run into
problems when the offset is $FFFF. Third, you can move even
less if the original addresses do not both have offset 0.

To handle all cases, you should try for moving a little less.
The following moves only 63KB. You could move 64K-16 bytes. I
tested this routine with the longtype array upperbound 16 (it
works with any multiple of 16).

By using a fast move for 63KB you gain almost all the speed you
can; it is probably not worth writing the glue code in ASM.

The speed gain over the builtin MOVE procedure is around 38% on
my machine (486/33). A test program ran for 2.58 seconds with
ASM, 4.17 seconds with MOVE.
