This is getting off-topic for the echo.  Please, if what you have to say has
nothing to do with programming in Pascal, don't say it here.

 Subject: FDIV fix for BP (fast & exact)
 Date: 1 Dec 1994 11:07:51 GMT

I have been working with Cleve Moler (from MathWorks) and Tim Coe about a sw
workaround for the Pentium FDIV bug.  Here is a BP version of the algorithm:

The FDIV_FIX unit defines a single function:

function fdiv(x: extended; y: extended): extended;

which will use about 25% more cycles than a single fdiv call, but always return
exact results for all double precision numbers, including the special cases of
Nan, Inf and denormal.
It also handles all extended precision numbers, giving a maximum error of a
single bit in the last position (1ulp).  This error can only be introduced if
the FDIV operations fails.
During the unit startup code, I test the FDIV instruction, and if if fails,
initialize a 16-byte table of critical nibble values.

If FDIV passes, the table is left empty, and no fixups will be done on
divisions.
