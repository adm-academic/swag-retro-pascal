    edition; by Jean Meeus; publisher: Willmann-Bell Inc.,

                            Date of Easter.

    The method used below has been given by Spencer Jones in his
    book "General Astronomy" (pages 73-74 of the edition of 1922).
    It has been published again in the "Journal of the British
    Astronomical Association", Vol.88, page 91 (December 1977)
    where it is said that it was devised in 1876 and appeared in
    the Butcher's "Ecclesiastical Calendar."

    Unlike the formula given by Guass, this method has no exception
    and is valid for all years in the Gregorian calendar, that is
    from the year 1583 on.

    [...text omitted...]

    The extreme dates of Easter are March 22 (as in 1818 and 2285)
    and April 25 (as in 1886, 1943, 2038).
