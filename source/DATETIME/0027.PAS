Zeller's Congruence is an algorithm that calculates a day of the week given
a year, month and day. Created in 1887(!). Jeff Duntemann of PC Techniques
fame implemented it in TP in the 11/90 issue of Dr Dobbs Journal, With a
(115 min left), (H)elp, More? major kludge because TP's MOD operator returns a remainder instead of a
True mathematical modulus. I added the Kludge Alert banner that I use in my
own code.

    Century := Year div 100;
    Year    := Year MOD 100;

    { but that January and February are months #13 and #14,     }
