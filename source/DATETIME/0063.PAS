Unix timestamps are the number of *seconds* since midnight Jan 1, 1970.

     days := timestamp div 86400;
timestamp := timestamp mod 86400;
    hours := timestamp div 3600;
timestamp := timestamp mod 3600;
  minutes := timestamp div 60;
  seconds := timestamp mod 60;

Day 0 is Jan 1, 1970. Day 1 is Jan 2, 1970, etc.

Converting the day count to a date is left as an excercise for the student.

Also, be aware that since you'll have to be reading the timestamp into
a longint, the value goes *negative* in 2038 (actually it just rolls
over into the highest bit, but TP longints use that for storing the sign.
