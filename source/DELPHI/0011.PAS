Q: How can I make a form move by clicking and dragging in the client area
   instead of on the caption bar?

A: The easiest way to do this is to "fool" Windows into thinking that
   you're actually clicking on the caption bar of a form.  Do this by
   handling the wm_NCHitTest windows message as shown in the sample unit
   below.

   TIP: If you want a captioness borderless window similar to a floating
   toolbar, set the Form's Caption to an empty string, disable all of the

   BorderIcons, and set the BorderStyle to bsNone.

  if  M.Result = htClient then  { is the click in the client area?   }
    M.Result := htCaption;      { if so, make Windows think it's     }
                                { on the caption bar.                }
