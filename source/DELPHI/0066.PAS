If you have the VCL source look at TMemoryStream - it is pretty efficient
for 286 code.  If you are willing to only run on 386 machines you can use
386 32-bit addressing in assembly code to access the data.  Following the
includion I have placed some assembly code I have written to do this.  It
compiles under MASM and is linked with the {$L} directive.  The reason I
wrote this code was for a WinG module I am still working on.  Anyone is
welcome to use this code, but I would like to see work done using it.
