{
Here is a Delphi unit for a modal dialog to support Query By Form
(QBF) for DbGrid components which receive data from Table components
(not Query components).

The lack of this as a built-in feature makes it harder for Delphi to
compete with more resource-intensive tools like Oracle Forms.
This unit is not as powerful as the built-in QBF features of Oracle
Forms, but it does fill a significant gap in functionality.

Note that the unit is copyrighted, as required by Borland's license,
and as desired by me to retain credit for its development.

{ This unit provides a basic but effective Query By Form service
  for database access applications written using Borland Delphi.
  This unit also provides a similar Sort By Form service.

  The Query By Form service displays a modal dialog box with a StringGrid
  of searchable fields, taken from the calling DbGrid.  The user may
  enter an exact search value for any number of fields, and may use
  drag and drop to rearrange the sort order of the fields.
  (Only the fields that contain search values are relevant to the sort.)
  When the user clicks the dialog's OK button, this unit modifies the
  calling DbGrid's IndexFieldNames property, applies a search range
  (of exact values), and refreshes the data.
  If the user leaves all search values empty, this unit clears the
  calling DbGrid's IndexFieldNames property, clears the search range,
  and refreshes the data.

  The Sort By Form service works in a similar manner, except that it
  does not accept search values from the user.  The user drags and drops
  the field sort order, then clicks the OK button.  This unit modifies
  the calling DbGrid's IndexFieldNames property, clears the search range,
  and refreshes the data.
}

{ Create the corresponding dialog form using the New Form action,
  selecting a Standard Dialog Box.  Place a StringGrid on the form
  (as found in the Additional tab of the component toolbar.
  Set the StringGrid's Height to 161 and its Width to 305.
  Finally, replace the new form's .PAS source with this unit.

{ The following two procedures provide the mechanism for accessing
  the services of this unit.

  Have a button or menu item on the calling form call one of these
  procedures, passing the DbGrid as the argument.  (Remember to add
  "uses Db_QBF;" to the calling form's implementation section.)

  Restriction:  The DbGrid must reference a DataSource that, in turn,
  references a DataSet that is a Table.  This unit does not support
  a DataSet that is a Query, since it has no IndexFieldNames property.
