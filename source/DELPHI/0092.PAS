not too big of a program but supposed to be cool.  will minimize all
windows as it executes delphi.

Well, it compiles and works for me. What you have to do is:
        - open a new project;
        - close form1 and unit1;
        - open the project source;
        - paste the whole code above over what is already there;
        - save the project as exdelphi.DPR;
        - build. {result is an EXE of 4K}
