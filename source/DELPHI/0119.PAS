
Delphi employs a number of files for its configuration, some
global to the Delphi environment, some project specific.  Chief
among all the configuration files is DELPHI.INI.  DELPHI.INI
resides in the Windows directory and contains most of the
configurable items to be found within Delphi.  Being the largest
Delphi configuration file, DELPHI.INI contains settings to
control the Delphi speed bar, component palette, component
library, gallery, installed experts, editor, printing, tools menu
and all the environment options found on the Environment Options
dialog.  This document will explore DELPHI.INI in depth.

DELPHI.CBT is a copy of DELPHI.INI (minus the ReportSmith
section) that is installed along with Delphi and may serve as a
sort of backup for restoring the original Delphi setup.  It
resides in the Windows directory along with DELPHI.INI.  Below is
the ReportSmith section and its one entry that should be placed
in a DELPHI.INI created from DELPHI.CBT.

[ReportSmith]
ExePath=C:\RPTSMITH


Delphi also makes use of Desktop (.DSK) files.  Desktop files,
like most Delphi configuration files, are formatted in the same
manner as .INI files, with section headers and individual
settings in each section.  The purpose of desktop files is to
retain the appearance and content of the Delphi desktop between
sessions or between projects.  Each desktop file contains
information regarding the presence and appearance of the Delphi
main window, the Object Inspector, the Alignment Palette, the
Project Manager, and the Watch, Breakpoint, CallStack, and
component list windows.  Also kept in each desktop file is the
number of editor windows open as well as the names, number and
order of files open in each editor window.

If the 'Desktop files' check box (on the Preferences page of the
Environment Options dialog) is checked, Delphi will automatically
create desktop files for each project closed and saved.  Each
desktop file carries the same root name as the saved project
file.  If no project is active when Delphi exits, a default
desktop file, DELPHI.DSK, is created.  The last active project
determines which desktop file Delphi loads at startup.  Again,
if no project was active when Delphi exited last, then DELPHI.DSK
is loaded.  While project specific desktop files reside in the
same directory with the corresponding project, DELPHI.DSK resides
in the \DELPHI\BIN directory.  The PrivateDir setting in the
Globals section of DELPHI.INI may be used to relocate DELPHI.DSK
to a different location.


Option files (.OPT) are another INI-like file in which Delphi
maintains values directly corresponding to those settings on the
Compiler, Linker, and  Directories/Conditionals pages of the
Project Options dialog.  Each of these pages has a corresponding
section in the option file and each setting has a individual
entry in that section.  Each option file also retains the last
parameter string entered via the Run Parameters dialog.  An
option file is created for each project saved.  Like .DSK files,
the root name of the .OPT file is the same as its corresponding
project and reside in the same directory as that project.

A default option file, DEFPROJ.OPT, is created if the Default
check box of the Project Options dialog is checked.  The settings
in DEFPROJ.OPT serve as the default project settings each time a
new project is created.


Additionally, the Delphi command line compiler, DCC.EXE, supports
the use of the configuration file DCC.CFG.  DCC.CFG is a text
file opened when the command line compiler starts and is used in
addition to options entered on the command line.  Command line
options may be placed in DCC.CFG, each on a separate line.  When
DCC starts, it looks for DCC.CFG in the current directory.  If it
is not found there, the directory in which DCC.EXE resides is
then searched.  A sample DCC.CFG follows:

/b
/q
/v
/eC:\DELPHI\WORK

The above settings instruct the command line compiler to build
all units (/b), compile without displaying file names and line
numbers (/q), append debug information to the .EXE (/v), and
place the compiled units and exEcutable in the C:\DELPHI\WORK
directory (/eC:\DELPHI\WORK).  The contents of the installed
DCC.CFG are included below to serve in restoring it should it be
deleted or damaged.

/m
/cw
/rD:\DELPHI\LIB
/uD:\DELPHI\LIB
/iD:\DELPHI\LIB


STDVCS.CFG is a file installed with the Client/Server of Delphi,
but is only used in conjunction with the Version Control manager
DLL.  The contents of the installed STDVCS.CFG are included here
to serve in restoring it should it be deleted or damaged.

NODELETEWORK WRITEPROTECT

COMMENTPREFIX .PRJ = "{ "

NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .FRM
NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .EXE
NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .DLL
NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .DOC
NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .ICO
NOEXPANDKEYWORDS .BMP

Lastly, MULTIHLP.INI is a file Delphi uses to provide
context-sensitive help across multiple help files.  This file
should not be modified; doing so may cause the Delphi Help system
to behave erratically.  The contents of the installed
MULTIHLP.INI are included here to serve in restoring it should it
be deleted or damaged.

Note:

What follows below is a comprehensive dissection of the
DELPHI.INI file.  In order to save space, a few conventions were
observed in the describing possible values for settings.

Where only one of a limited set of values is applicable, a pipe
symbol is used to separate each of the possible value, e.g.:

MapFile=0|1|2|3

allows only the values 0, 1, 2, or 3

Where a single value within a range is applicable, the range of
values is presented inside brackets with the minimum and maximum
values separated by two periods, e.g.:

GridSizeX=[2..128]

permits any value between 2 and 128, inclusively.

=================================================================

Section: [Globals]  -  The Globals section contains settings not
         included in other sections and that have an effect on
         Delphi as a whole.  Items in the Globals section may be
         changed only by editing DELPHI.INI.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PrivateDir=

  This item controls where Delphi both creates and locates
  the files DELPHI.DSK, DELPHI.DMT, DEFPROJ.OPT and STDVCS.CFG.
  The default location is the \DELPHI\BIN directory.  If Delphi
  is run from a read-only directory (or from a CD-ROM) this item
  should be set to a writeable directory, either on a network or
  local drive.  This item should contain a fully qualified path,
  including the drive letter.  Example:

    PrivateDir=J:\USERS\JSMITH   ; Private network directory


HintColor=

  This item controls the color of the fly-by hint window for the
  Delphi IDE.  The value may be a decimal or hex constant, or one
  of the symbolic color constants defined in VCL (e.g. clCyan).
  Note that the text in the hint window is always painted using
  clWindowText.  The default value is clYellow.

PropValueColor=

  This item controls the color of the text in the right-hand
  (value) pane of the Object Inspector. The value may be a
  decimal or hex constant, or one of the symbolic color constants
  defined in VCL (e.g. clBlue).  The default value is
  clWindowText.



Section: [Library]  -  The Library section contains entries for
         those settings found on the Library page of the
         Environment Options dialog (accessed via
         Options|Environment).  The options in this section take
         effect when the Options|Rebuild Library menu option is
         chosen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SearchPath=

  Specifies search paths where the compiler can find the units
  needed to build the component library.  Path names should be
  listed consecutively, separated by a semicolon.  This entry is
  changed via the 'Library Path' combo box.  Example:

    SearchPath=D:\DELPHI\LIB;d:\delphi\rcexpert


ComponentLibrary=

  Specifies the name of the active component library.  This item
  is changed via the Options|Open Library menu option.  It may
  also be changed from the 'Library filename' edit of the Install
  Components dialog (accessed via Options|Install Components).
  Example:

    ComponentLibrary=D:\DELPHI\BIN\REXPERT.DCL

SaveLibrarySource=0|1

  Indicates whether Delphi saves the source code for the
  component library when installing new components or rebuilding
  it via Options|Rebuild Library.  A setting of 1 causes the
  project source to be saved using the library file's root name
  with a .DPR extension.  The default value is 0.  This setting
  is changed via the 'Save library source code' check box.


MapFile=0|1|2|3

  Determines the type of map file produced, if any, when the
  component library is rebuilt. The map file is placed in the
  same directory as the library, and it has a .MAP extension.
  The default value is 0.  This setting is changed via the
  'Map file' radio button group.

  Option        Effect
  ------------  ------
  0 - Off	Does not produce map file.
  1 - Segments	Linker produces a map file that includes a list
                of segments, the program start address, and any
                warning or error messages produced during the
                link.
  2 - Publics	Linker produces a map file that includes a list
                of segments, the program start address, any
                warning or error messages produced during the
                link, and a list of alphabetically sorted public
                symbols.
  3 - Detailed	Linker produces a map file that includes a list
                of segments, the program start address, any
                warning or error messages produced during the
                link, a list of alphabetically sorted public
                symbols, and an additional detailed segment map.
                The detailed segment map includes the address,
                length in bytes, segment name, group, and module

LinkBuffer=0|1

  Specifies the location of the link buffer.  A setting of 1
  causes Delphi to use available disk space for the link buffer;
  0 causes the use of available memory.  The default value is
  0.  This setting is changed via the 'Link Buffer' radio button
  group.


DebugInfo=0|1

  Determines whether the component library file is compiled and
  linked with debug information.  A setting of 1 causes the
  inclusion of debug information.  The default setting is 0.  The
  setting is changed via the 'Compile with debug info' check box.



Section: [Gallery]  -  The Gallery section controls the use and
         base location of the form and project galleries.  It
         contains those settings found in the Gallery: group box
         on the Preferences page of the Environment Options
         dialog.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

BaseDir=

  Points to the directory where Delphi attempts to find Gallery
  files.  To share a gallery directory with other users, set this
  item to point to a shared network directory.  This item
  should contain a fully qualified path, including the drive
  letter.  This entry may be changed only by editing DELPHI.INI.
  Example:

    BaseDir=D:\DELPHI\GALLERY

GalleryProjects=0|1

  Indicates whether Delphi displays the Browse Gallery dialog box
  when the File|New Project menu option is chosen.  A setting of
  1 causes the Browse Gallery dialog box to display.  The default
  setting is 0.  The setting is changed via the 'Use on New
  Project' check box.


GalleryForms=0|1

  Indicates whether Delphi displays the Browse Gallery dialog box
  when the File|New Form menu option is chosen.  A setting of 0
  prevents the Browse Gallery dialog box from displaying.  The
  default setting is 1.  The setting is changed via the 'Use on
  New Form' check box.



Section: [Experts]  -  The Experts section lists the Experts
         which Delphi will attempt to load and initialize upon
         startup.  Any value may be used on the left of the
         equals sign, as the item name is not interpreted.
         Borland recommends using a combination of the vendor
         name and the product name. Example:

  [Experts]
  ComponentWare.CommExpert=c:\delphi\cware\commexpt.dll
  CodeFast.TheExpert=c:\delphi\codefast\codefast.dll



Section: [ReportSmith]  -  The ReportSmith section contains just
         one entry which specifies the directory in which
         ReportSmith is installed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ExePath=

  ExePath indicates the location of RPTSMITH.EXE.  This entry is
  placed in DELPHI.INI at install time and may be changed only by
  editing DELPHI.INI.  Example:

    ExePath=D:\RPTSMITH



Section: [Session]  -  The Session section and its one entry
                       identify the active project when Delphi
                       was last closed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Project=

  Identifies the active project when Delphi was last closed.
  This setting is only meaningful if the DesktopFile setting in
  the AutoSave section is set to 1.  This setting also serves to
  identify the project's desktop file (using a .DSK extension).
  This setting is updated automatically when Delphi exits.
  Example:

    Project=D:\DELPHI\WORK\MAILAPP.DPR



Section: [MainWindow]  -  The MainWindow section defines
         characteristics of the Delphi main window as they relate
         to the speedbar and component palette.  The SpeedBar
         Layout section details the actual contents of the
         speedbar.  Likewise, the <libraryname>.Palette section
         details the actual contents of the component palette.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Split=[-1..400]

  Indicates the horizontal position if the vertical bar
  separating the speedbar and component palette.  The default
  value is 183.  This setting is changed by moving the split bar
  with the mouse.


SpeedHints=0|1

  Determines whether hints are displayed as the mouse passes over
  buttons on the speedbar.  A setting of 0 prevents the display
  of speedbar hints.  The default setting is 1.  This setting is
  changed using the Show Hints menu option of the speedbar
  speedmenu.


PaletteHints=0|1

  Determines whether hints are displayed as the mouse passes over
  buttons on the palette.  A setting of 0 prevents the display

Section: [Editor]  -  This section describes the appearance and
         behavior of the Delphi Code Editor.  Settings from both
         the Editor options and Editor display pages are detailed
         here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

DefaultWidth=
DefaultHeight=

  These two items, if present, control the initial width and
  height of the Delphi Code Editor window.  Delphi does not
  update these values, but it does read them each time a Code
  Editor is created.  The default width is 406; the default
  height is 234.  These settings may be changed only by editing
  DELPHI.INI.


FontName=
FontSize=

  These settings specify the name and size, respectively, of a
  mono-spaced font that the Code Editor uses to display text.
  Courier New is the default font, 10 the default size.  These
  entries may be changed via the 'Editor font:' and 'Size:' combo
  boxes on the Editor display page.


BlockIndent=[1..16]

  Specifies the number of spaces to indent a marked block.  The
  default value is 1.  This setting may be changed via the 'Block
  indent' combo box on the Editor display page.


UndoLimit=[0..]

  Specifies the number of keystrokes that can be undone, which is
  limited by available memory.  The default value is 32,767.
  This setting may be changed via the 'Undo limit:' combo box on
  the Editor Options page.


TabRack=

  Determines the columns at which the cursor will move to each
  time the Tab key is pressed.  Each successive tab stop must be
  separated by a space and must be larger than its predecessor.
  If only one number is specified, tab stops are spaced apart
  evenly, using that number.  If two numbers are specified then
  tab stops occur at the specified positions and at positions
  that mark the difference between the two values.  The default
  tab stops are 9 and 17.  This setting may be changed via the
  'Tab stops:' combo box on the Editor Options page.  Note:
  this option has no effect if the smart tabs setting is enabled.


RightMargin=[0..1024]

  Specifies the right margin of the Code Editor.  The default
  value is 80.  The valid range is 0 to 1024.  This setting may
  be changed via the 'Right margin:' combo box on the Editor
  display page.


Extensions=

 Combo Box
  Specifies file masks of those files that will display with
  syntax highlighting.  Typically, only specific extensions are
  included.  The default setting is
  '*.PAS;*.DPR;*.DFM;*.INC;*.INT'.  This setting may be changed
  via the 'Syntax extensions:' combo box on the Editor Options
  page.  Example:

    Extensions=*.PAS;*.DPR;*.SRC


FindTextAtCursor=0|1

  When set to 1, causes Delphi to Place the text at the cursor
  into the 'Text To Find' combo box in the Find Text dialog box
  when the Search|Find menu option is chosen.   When set to 0,
  the default setting, the search text must be typed in.  This
  entry may be changed via the 'Find text at cursor' check box
  on the Editor Options page.


BRIEFRegularExpressions=0|1

  When set to 1, permits the use of Brief-style regular
  expressions when searching for text.  The default setting is 0.
  This entry may be changed via the 'BRIEF regular expressions'
  check box on the Editor Options page.


PreserveLineEnds=0|1

  Determines whether end-of-line characters are changed to
  carriage return/line feed pairs or are preserved.  When
  set to 0, Delphi converts end-of-line characters to carriage
  return/line feed pairs.  The default value is 1.  This
  entry may be changed via the 'Preserve Line Ends' check box
  on the Editor display page.


FullZoom=0|1

  Determines whether the Code Editor fills the entire screen when
  maximized.  When set to 0 (the default), the Code Editor does

  entry may be changed via the 'Double click line' check box on
  the Editor Options page.


BRIEFCursors=0|1

  Determines whether Delphi uses BRIEF-style cursor shapes in the
  Code Editor.  A setting of 1 causes Delphi to use Brief-style
  cursors.  The default setting is 0.  This setting may be
  changed via the 'BRIEF cursor shapes' check box on the Editor
  Display page.


ForceCutCopyEnabled=0|1

  When set to 1, enables the Edit|Cut and Edit|Copy menu options,

            enabled, this option is off.
        16  Backspace un-indents - Aligns the insertion point to
            the previous indentation level (out-dents it) when
            Backspace is pressed, if the cursor is on the first
            nonblank character of a line.
        32  Keep trailing blanks - Saves trailing spaces and tabs
            present at the end of a line.
        64  Optimal fill - Begins every auto-indented line with
            the minimum number of characters possible, using tabs

            with whatever is typed next.  If Persistent Blocks is
            also selected, text entered is added to the currently
            selected block.
      4096  Create backup file - Creates a backup file when
            source files are saved.  This item is set via the
            'Create backup file' check box on the Editor Display
            page.
      8192  Use Syntax highlight - Enables syntax highlighting.

            save.


EditorSpeedSetting=0|1|2|3

  Determines which editor emulation scheme was last selected.
  Changing this setting directly does not affect the actual
  keystroke mapping or the editor options used.  The Editor
  SpeedSetting combo box does not save emulation schemes; it
  only serves as a quick means of setting many editor options at
  once.  The default setting is 0.  The table below shows each
  value's corresponding speedsetting.

    Value  SpeedSetting
    -----  ------------
