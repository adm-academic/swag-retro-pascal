That code will not work in Delphi 2.0 because the GetModuleUsage function
doesn't exist under Win32.  You can get this behavior, however, using the
Win32 CreateProcess function.  Here is a function I use to wait for another
program to finish execution:
*)

function CreateProcessAndWait(const AppPath, AppParams: String;
                              Visibility: word): DWord;
var
  SI: TStartupInfo;
  PI: TProcessInformation;
  Proc: THandle;
begin
  FillChar(SI, SizeOf(SI), 0);
  SI.cb := SizeOf(SI);
  SI.wShowWindow := Visibility;
  if not CreateProcess(PChar(AppPath), PChar(AppParams), Nil, Nil, False,
                   Normal_Priority_Class, Nil, Nil, SI, PI) then
    raise Exception.CreateFmt('Failed to execute program.  Error Code %d',
                              [GetLastError]);
  Proc := PI.hProcess;
  CloseHandle(PI.hThread);
  if WaitForSingleObject(Proc, Infinite) <> Wait_Failed then
    GetExitCodeProcess(Proc, Result);
  CloseHandle(Proc);
end;
