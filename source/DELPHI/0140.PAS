{procedure that deals with the windows WM_CLOSE message -

 I'm sure that there are far easier ways of dealing with posting records, but
 this way illustrates some of the concepts behind Windows. Of course, in response
 to "mrYes" we could simply use "close;" but I've included a PostMessage method
 that provides an example of how to send messages to Windows.

 Note that this subroutine could be useful for database applications, where the
 a record has not yet been posted and the user tries to close down the form}

 sTitle: string;
 pTitle: PChar;
 iTitle: integer;
