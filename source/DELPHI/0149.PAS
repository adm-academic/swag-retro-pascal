Try something like the following:
}

  procedure CopyDos (FileIn, FileOut: PChar);
  var
    CommandLine: array[0..$FF] of Char;
  begin
  StrCopy (CommandLine, GetEnvVar ('COMSPEC'));
  StrCat  (CommandLine, ' /c copy ');
  StrCat  (CommandLine, FileIn);
  StrCat  (CommandLine, ' ');
  StrCat  (CommandLine, FileOut);
  WinExec (CommandLine, sw_Hide);
  end;

COMSPEC is necessary in case you are running DR DOS.
