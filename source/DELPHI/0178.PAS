unit WinExc32;

// This unit is based upon the well-known and largely used WinExecAndWait function
// The former WinexecAndWait function doesn't compile under Delphi 2.0 because the
// GetModuleUsage function is no longer supported under Win95.
// I have simply updated the previous code so that it works with Delphi 2.0
// under Windows 95. With this function you can call Windows-based applications
// as well as Dos-based commands. That is 'c:\myapp\app32.exe' as well as
// 'command.com /c del *.bak'.
// This new WinexecAndWait32 is intended for Delphi 2.0 Win95 only,
// it works for me but you use it at your own risk.

// Updated : July 31, 1996.
