This TI demonstrates how to make your Delphi 2.0
application "sing" by loading and playing a wave file
four different ways:

1) Use the sndPlaySound() function to directly
play a wave file.

2) Read the wave file into memory, then use the
sndPlaySound() to play the wave file

3) Use sndPlaySound to directly play a wave
file thats embedded in a resource file attached
to your application.

4) Read a wave file thats embedded in a resource
 file attached to your application into memory,
 then use the sndPlaySound() to play the wave file.

 To build the project you will need to:

1) Create a wave file called 'hello.wav'
in the project's directory.

2) Create a text file called 'snddata.rc'
in the project's directory.

3) Add the following line to the file 'snddata.rc':
HELLO WAVE hello.wav

4) At a dos prompt, go to your project directory
and compile the .rc file using the Borland Resource
compiler (brcc32.exe) by typing the path to brcc32.exe
and giving 'snddata.rc' as a parameter.

Example:

bin\brcc32 snddata.rc

This will create the file 'snddata.res' that
Delphi will link with your application's .exe
file.

Final Note: Keep on Jamm'n!
