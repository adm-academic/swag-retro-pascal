
{With my last project if a disk is not in say one of the Floppy drives
or my CDRom drive it will crash so i used this function that borland
suggest
}

function DiskInDrive(Drive: Char): Boolean;
var
  ErrorMode: word;

ok it stops the program from crashing but it shows
I/O 32 error message the question is how do i show them another message
telling the user that thay need to pop in a disk.
And pop the Drive Combo box back to the Hard Drive.

I'm using the following snippet in cmbDrive.OnChange event. Be sure NOT
to connect lstDir through DirList property of cmbDrive. It's a bit like a
batch file, but it works for me OK in Delphi 2 :)

procedure TfrmMain.cmbDriveChange(Sender: TObject);
var
   OldDrive: char;

label
   Retry;

   function SetDrive(const NewDrive: char): boolean;
   begin
      try
         lstDir.Drive := NewDrive;
         Result := true;
      except
         Result := false;
      end;
   end;

begin

Retry:
   OldDrive := lstDir.Drive;

   if not SetDrive(cmbDrive.Drive) then begin
      beep;
      if MessageBox(Handle, PChar(UpperCase(cmbDrive.Drive) + ':\ is not accessible.'#13#13'Drive not ready.'),
         'Error', mb_RetryCancel or mb_IconStop or mb_DefButton1) =
IDRETRY then
            goto Retry
      else
         begin
            lstDir.Drive := OldDrive;
            cmbDrive.Drive := lstDir.Drive;
         end;
   end;

end;
