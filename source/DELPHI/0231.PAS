In answer to a fellow subscriber's request, I recently posted to this list a
Delphi Assembler procedure to reverse ShortStrings. After someone pointed out
to me in a private message that my routine was slower than his all-Pascal
alternative, I tried again, and managed to come up with an asm procedure that
actually has a (modest) speed advantage. It is presented below, in case
anyone else can use it.
