Proper? I don't know about its propriety, but the following routine
works.

Please note that this doesn't override the rich edit control's
standard paste function, so sending it a WM_PASTE message, (by
pressing Ctrl-V, perhaps) will still paste formatted text.

procedure PasteTextOnly(dest: TRichEdit);
var
  MyHandle: THandle;
  TextPtr: PChar;
begin
  ClipBoard.Open;
  Try
    MyHandle := Clipboard.GetAsHandle(CF_TEXT);
    TextPtr := GlobalLock(MyHandle);
    try
      dest.SetSelTextBuf(TextPtr);
    finally
      GlobalUnlock(MyHandle);
    end;
  finally
    Clipboard.Close;
  end;
end;
