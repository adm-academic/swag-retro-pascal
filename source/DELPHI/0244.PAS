When I started using Delphi 1, I had a big struggle with ReportSmith and
gave it up. I did all my printing with an object called TPrinto. I gave
the object some nice methods to ease my printing, The following
procedure uses PixelsPerInch. I like to use centimeters so I translated
the Inches to cm's.

procedure TPrinto.StartDoc;
begin
   pageNo := 0;
   Printer.Canvas.Font.Name := 'MS SansSerif';
   Printer.Canvas.Font.Size := 10;
   Printer.Canvas.Pen.width := 4;
   Printer.Canvas.TextOut(0, 0, '');
   TextHeight := Abs(Printer.Canvas.Font.Height);
   LinesPerPage := Printer.PageHeight div (TextHeight + 4);
   cm := Round(Printer.Canvas.Font.PixelsPerInch / 2.54);
   LeftMargin := Round(1.5 * cm);
   CurrentLine := 0;
end;
