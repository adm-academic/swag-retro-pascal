In Delphi 2 and Windows 95 I tested the code below and it works.
Notice that I have included WinSock in the uses clause. Delphi 2 comes with
winsock.dcu but I believe that Delphi 1 does not have it.
Search the Delphi Super Page (http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/delphi/),
probably there will be useful sockets/TCPIP components that will help you.

Code follows...
-----------------------------------------
unit Unit1;

interface

uses
  Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms, Dialogs,
  WinSock, StdCtrls;

type
  TForm1 = class(TForm)
    Edit1: TEdit;
    procedure FormShow(Sender: TObject);
  private
    { Private declarations }
  public
    { Public declarations }
  end;

var
  Form1: TForm1;

implementation

{$R *.DFM}

procedure TForm1.FormShow(Sender: TObject);
type pu_long = ^u_long;
var varTWSAData : TWSAData;
    varPHostEnt : PHostEnt;
    varTInAddr : TInAddr;
    namebuf : Array[0..255] of char;
begin
  If WSAStartup($101,varTWSAData) <> 0 Then
    Edit1.Text := 'WSAStartup error!'
  Else Begin
    gethostname(namebuf,sizeof(namebuf));
    varPHostEnt := gethostbyname(namebuf);
    varTInAddr.S_addr := u_long(pu_long(varPHostEnt^.h_addr_list^)^);
    Edit1.Text := inet_ntoa(varTInAddr);
  End;
  WSACleanup;
end;

end.
