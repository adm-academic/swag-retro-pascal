I was looking for some procedure or unit that would list file in directory
and all its subdirectories. I have found one procedure in SWAG that should
do something like DELTREE but it didn't work as I wanted, well it did work
but after some number of directories exception EInOutError occurred when
trying to change to directory and then I wrote this... It's recursive
procedure that will list files and directories in given directory and
all its subdirectories. Filenames and directories will be listed in
specified ListBox

procedure TForm1.ListDir(Path:String; List:TListBox);
{Path : string that contains start path for listing filenames and directories
 List : List box in which found filenames are going to be stored }

SearchRec:TsearchRec;
Result:integer;
S:string; { Used to hold current directory, GetDir(0,s) }
begin
     try {Exception handler }
        ChDir(Path);
     except on EInOutError do
            begin

     end;
     if length(path)<> 3 then path:=path+'\';   { Checking if path is root, if not add }
     FindFirst(path+'*.*',faAnyFile,SearchRec); { '\' at the end of the string         }
                                                { and then add '*.*' for all file     }
     Repeat
           if SearchRec.Attr=faDirectory then   { if directory then }
