I have written a program that collects information that a user selects, by
a number of checkboxes and buttons, to a non visible RichEdit box.  The
program was written under Windows 95 and works fine.  But under NT 4.0 the
line ...

RichEdit1.Print(''); 

returns a Divide by Zero Error.  The only way I have found round this is to
save the file and use Word to print the final file.

Does anyone have or know of any workrounds?

Yes, I have a solution and a fix...
To fix this problem requires a minor change to the VCL unit ComCtrls.pas.

I've tested this on many different systems running NT 4.0 and Win95, and all seems to work well now. It's actually a very simple fix, and here it is...

{
A compatibility problem exists with the original RichEdit.Print method
code and the release of NT 4.0.  A EDivByZero exception is caused because
accessing the Printer.Handle property outside of a BeginDoc/EndDoc block
returns an Information Context (IC) handle under NT 4.0 instead of a
Device Context (DC) handle.  The EM_FORMATRANGE attempts to use this IC
instead of a real printer DC, which causes the exception.  If the Handle
property is accessed AFTER the BeginDoc, a true Device Context handle is
returned, and I have modified the code to handle this correctly.  I have
left the original position of BeginDoc in the code but remarked it out to
indicate the difference.    J.V.Bacus 11/12/96
