
Since I installed IE4, some of my mails are sometime removed without a =
warning. Anybody knows why?. May be I just miss a simple setup.  =20

Here is the code to use to drag a component on a form at run-time.=20

procedure TForm1.Button1MouseDown(Sender: TObject; Button: TMouseButton;
  Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer);
const
  SC_DragMove =$F012; // what a number
begin
  ReleaseCapture; // See Win32 API help
  Button1.perform(WM_SysCommand, SC_DragMove, 0);
end.
