Here is a function that does this. It gets the parent control, and then iterates through its children, looking for a match. This has been tested and works.

{ function to return index order of a component in its parent's
    component collection; returns -1 if not found or no parent }
function IndexInParent(vControl: TControl): integer;
var
  ParentControl: TWinControl;
begin
  {we "cousin" cast to get at the protected Parent property in base class }
  ParentControl := TForm(vControl.Parent);
  if (ParentControl <> nil) then
  begin
    for Result := 0 to ParentControl.ControlCount - 1 do
    begin
      if (ParentControl.Controls[Result] = vControl) then Exit;
    end;
  end;
  { if we make it here, then wasn't found, or didn't have parent}
  Result := -1;
end;
