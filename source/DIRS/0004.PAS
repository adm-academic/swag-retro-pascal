The easiest way would be to use the findfirst() and findnext()
Procedures. Here's a stub Program in TP. You'll need to put code in
the main routine to handle command line arguments, and call fsplit()
to split up the Filenames to pass to searchDir() or searchAllDirs().
then just put whatever processing you want to do With each File in
the process() Procedure.

{
 Both searchDir and searchAllDirs require the following parameters
 path  - the path to the File, which must end With a backslash.
         if there is no ending backslash these won't work.
 fspec - the File specification.

Procedure SearchDir(Path : PathStr; fspec : String);

  Findfirst(Path + fspec, AnyFile, f);

    Findnext(f);
