reread it again and a bit closer this time... it says that DS:DX point
to a FCB (File Control Block) not a filename...

there are two types of FCBs... standard and extended... the sFCB is
37bytes long and the eFCB is 45bytes long... an unopened FCB has only
the drive number, the filename, and the file extension filled in... so
basically, we could start off like this for the sFCB...

  sFCBrec = record
              drivenum  : byte;                   { 0 }
              filename  : array[ 1..8 ] of char;  { 1 - 8 }
              fileext   : array[ 9..11] of char;  { 9 - 11}
              restofFCB : array[12..36] of byte;  {12 - 36}
            end;

and the eFCB looks like this...

  eFCBrec = record
              flagbyte  : byte;                   {-7 }
              reserved  : array[-6..-2] of byte;  {-6 - -2 }
              fattrib   : byte;                   {-1 }
              drivenum  : byte;                   { 0 }
              filename  : array[ 1..8 ] of char;  { 1 - 8 }
              fileext   : array[ 9..11] of char;  { 9 - 11}
              restofFCB : array[12..36] of byte;  {12 - 36}
            end;

sharp eyes will note the array[-6..-2] entry... i don't know (as i've
not tested it in actual compilation) if it'll work like that but the
point is to show that there is an additional 7byte block added to the
*beginning* of the sFCB...

the PSP offers location 5C as the start of a FCB but you can allocate
your own location(s) if you need to work with more than one file FCB at
a time. in any case, the address of the space you allocate for the FCB
is what you put in DS:DX ... maybe something like this...

{ TESTED CODE - FULLY FUNCTIONAL }
{ this is the first FCB code i've done. you'll have to locate the
  structures of the standard FCB and the extended FCB. there's a
  bit much in the books i have on them to type it all in here. as
  this is only a test program, i've only set up for those fields
  i really needed.

===== STOP =====

the books i have on them have much more text on the FCBs. too much to
try to post to you... what exactly is it that you are trying to do???
there are much easier methods for most things in this day in time...
it's highly recommended to NOT mess around with FCBs manipulations if
one doesn't really _have_ to...
