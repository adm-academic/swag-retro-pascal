 Below you'll find a program that lists all the directories on the C drive. It
 can be extended very easily but it just wanted to show the basics. (It was
 part of a program that did for dos what the DELTREE command does now. I used
 to work (good old days) with Dos 3.3 which doesn't have a DELTREE command)

    Info must be a local parameter of Show. This way the information in the
    SearchRec is saved when a subdirectory is explored using recursion.

   { We have to search the directory in Direct, build the search-path }
   if ( Direct[Length(Direct)] <> '\' ) THEN Direct := Direct + '\' ;
   FindFirst( Direct+'*.*', AnyFile, Info ) ;
   { As long as we have 'things' in the Direct directory, look at them }
   while ( DosError = 0 ) do
    begin
     if ( (Info.Name <> '.') and (Info.Name <> '..') and
          ( (Info.Attr and Directory) = Directory) )
