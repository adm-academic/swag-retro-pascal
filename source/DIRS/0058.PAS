 Dear SWAG-TEAM,
   I am a dutch student of English and I'm also interested in programming. In
   one of my programs I make use of 'reverse video', but I'm not satisfied
   with the way I achieve this 'reverse video'. I know it can be done much
   faster by writing and reading directly to/from video memory. Instead I have
   to call interrupt 10h for each character. Another problem I face is that I
   don't know how to store each character attribute separately. If different
   colors are used, this code is useless. I've included a part of the code I
   use as an example.
   I hope you can provide me with an answer to my questions.
 Your's sincerely,

 Harro Lissenberg
