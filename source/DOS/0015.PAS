  EXEC.PAS

  This program demonstrates the use of
  Pascal's EXEC function to execute
  either an individual DOS command or
  to move into a DOS Shell.

  You may enter any command you could
  normally enter at a DOS prompt and
  it will execute.  You may also hit
  RETURN without entering anything and
  you will enter into a DOS Shell, from
  which you can exit by typing EXIT.

  The program stops when you hit a
  'Q', upper or lower case.
