There is a dirty way of doing this, and it works With every Dos /
command-interpreter that I've tried it under, including Dos 6.0
in a Window under Windows, and 4Dos.

The Really nice thing about this way to do it, is that you can even
load TSR's etc. since the menu Program is not in memory at all and there is
no secondary command interpreter when the user executes his choice.

The trick is that you run your Program from a "self-modifying" batchFile.

--- MENU.BAT ---
:StartAgain
SET MENU=C:\Dos\MENU.BAT  ; Check this environment Var from your menu-prog
GOMENU.EXE                ; and abort if it is not set
SET MENU=
----------------

Lets say you want to run another batchFile from a menu choice f.x MY.BAT.
Let your Program modify the MENU.BAT to:
---
:StartAgain
SET MENU=C:\Dos\MENU.BAT
GOMENU.EXE
SET MENU=
CALL MY.BAT
GOTO StartAgain
---

When you want to terminate your menu-loop, simply modify the MENU.BAT
back to it's original state.

The menu Program can be shared from a network server.  There is no
limitations at all.  You can do Dos commands from the menu Without
having to load a second shell.

Following my .sig there is a short example Program.  It can't be run
directly since it Uses some libraries of mine, but you'll get an idea
of how to do it.
