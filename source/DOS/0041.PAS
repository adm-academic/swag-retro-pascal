{
 some days ago, Bryan Ellis (gt6918b@prism.gatech.edu)
 asked how one could, in TP, check whether a disk in a
 drive is formatted or not. I did not see any answer on
 this posted to the list, so here comes an 'extract' from
 code of mine which might help.

{ The following two procedures were extracted from old file
 copy programs of mine; Therefore they should be 'cleaned-up'
 and fixed up before being included in somebody's code.
 The purpose of the first one is to ensure that:
    a) the target disk (to be written to) is indeed
 present in the drive;
    b) the target disk is a formatted one. If it is
 not, then opportunity is provided for formatting by
 shelling to DOS (rather clumsy, but you get the idea ;-)).

  The purpose of the second procedure is partly redundant
  with that of the first one. It checks whether the disk
  is present in the drive, and it also warns when the disk
  is write protected.
  Calls to ancillary procedures for putting the cursor onto
  the right column and row on the screen, or to clean up
  the display, save and restore the screen, or warning noises
  etc., were removed, which explains the somewhat desultory
  code, which I had no time to rewrite :-( }

Procedure CheckDriv(driv : string; var OK:boolean;
       var cc:char   );
{* driv is the string holding the letter of the drive;        *}
{* OK is a global boolean var which must be true in order for  *}
{* the rest of the program to proceed.          *}
