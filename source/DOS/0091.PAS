Try "Advanced MSDOS Programming", by Ray Duncan (Microsoft Press) for details
about device driver writing.

A device driver is a binary image whose origin is at zero.  The first two
words in the header are always $FFFF.  Device attribute varies per device!
{ start of device driver header }
   ORG  0
dd -1          { Next device : longint = -1; }
dw $8800       { Device attribute word, "generic" driver for DOS 3 or later }
dw strategy    { Strategy routine offset (request header pointer entry) }
dw intrupt     { Interrupt routine offset (request entry point) }
db 'EXAMPLE '  { Eight character device name }
{ Global variables }
request_ptr LABEL dword
request_off  DW  ?
request_seg  DW  ?
{ end of device driver header }

{ "dos_func_table" is used by "intrupt" to call the routine that handles
  the requested function.  Example table with four command entries: }
max_cmd EQU 4
dos_func_table:  DW dosfunc0, nopcmd, nopcmd, badcmd
{ Typical table has 24 entries including nopcmd's and badcmd's.  dosfunc0
 initializes device driver interrupts and buffers, then gives ending address
 of the device driver (header + body) to DOS.

  saves the request. }

{ "Intrupt" routine handles request queued by "strategy".  Calls one of the
  subroutines in the function table depending upon the request number.  Each
  subroutine returns with exit status in AX.  Partial example: }
