the trouble is that the exec procedure doesn't support redirection of standard
input and standard output devices using the ">" and "<" chars, i.e. PKZIP
usually expects the comment to come from the "STDIN" standard input device
which normally is the keyboard. and with <MYBANNER.TXT from the commandline
you redirect the STDIN to the file MYBANNER.TXTSo you have to do the
redirection yourself ;)
That's how it works:

(The STDIN file handle is always handle #0.)
1. copy this STDIN handle into a new one (to restore it afterwards)
2. open your redirection file
3. force the duplication of your redirection file's handle into the
   STDIN handle #0 (and close the redirection file's hadle)
4. the STDIN handle now no longer refers to the keyboard, but to your
   redirection file. Run EXEC without the "<blabla..." stuff.
5. restore the old STDIN handle by forcing the duplication of your
   saved handle (from 1.) into handle 0.

hey, don't worry .. i did it for you ;)
i did a little error handling .. but it still could not work if there are too
few free file handles .. but this usually doesn't happen ;) and if it happens,
increase your FILES=?? in your CONFIG.SYSand if you change it in order to make
it fit into your prog: remember that ASCIIZfilename must always be declared as
a global variable!!
