{
I recently loaded some SWAG Pascal files from a CDROM and found the question -
How do you get or set the DOS version ?

Getting the DOS version is easy - call INT 21H, Function 30H - }
 
USES Dos;
 
procedure id_version;
 
var regs : registers;
 
begin
  regs.ah := $30;
  msdos( regs);
  write( 'DOS version = ', regs.al,'.' );
  IF ( regs.ah < 10 ) THEN write( '0' );
  writeln( regs.ah );
end;
 
Setting the DOS version is another matter - I suspect you will have to 
disassemble your boot files to do this. I've not tried it and cannot recommend 
it!

However, some DOS programs ( especially games ) do test the DOS version before
running by using the INT 21H Function 30H as above. This CAN be programmed
around by diverting calls to INT 21H to a custom handler and capturing the
Function 30 calls. I've included a minimal TSR to do this.
 
I can't see this being of any use to users with standard MSDOS setups as your
program still won't run but is of use if you have an unusual or custom setup
e.g. DRDOS or Novell DOS users. 
 
Many thanks anyway for the tips in the SWAG collection - I've used several
including WHATCPU routines, PCX file readers / writers and Douglas Webb's
JumpToInterrupt !
 
Finally - do you have a compuserve forum?

 If you have an interrupt handler and you want to jump to the original
 interrupt handler and NOT return to your handler.
 
 Call the following procedure with a pointer to the old interrupt handler
 ( which you'd better have saved ) :-
