 a few days ago (sorry, I didn't write down the name of the person
 who posted the question :-(), someone asked how one could
 identify a drive as a ramdisk.
 Below is a solution, which I submit with the hope that someone
 else could show how to improve on it, since it is not 'fail-safe'.
 Here it comes...

I had to write the procedure Getdrives twice in order to take into
account the changes in the DPB structure which occurred from DOS
4.0 onwards. Mostly, Ramdisks have only one File Allocation Table,
whereas other drive types have two. That's what a procedure such
as GetDiskClass of TurboPower Object Professional (usual disclaimer
here ;-)) uses to decide whether the drive is a ramdisk or not. BUT
BEWARE! This is not necessarily so! Norton mentions, in his 'disk
companion', that depending on the device driver of the ramdisk, one
or two FATS may be implemented. I could verify this on 'STACKED'
ramdisks: they have two FATS, whereas only one FAT is present after
'unSTACKING' :-(. Thus, the solution below is somewhat shaky.
