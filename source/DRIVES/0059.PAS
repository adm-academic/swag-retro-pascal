  0F0H is also the code for an unknown device for Service $1C.  I
  haven't tried it but have you looked at Service $44, function $08?  My
  sources tell me that this function (DOS 3.0 up) will return 0 in AX if
  the device is removable, 1 if a fixed disk, and $0F if invalid drive.

  Hang on... I'm trying it now.  It seemed to work here.  Below is the
  sample code I used (in TP 5.5).

   With Regs DO BEGIN
      AH := $44;
      AL := $08;
      BL := DriveNum;
      Intr($21, Regs);
      IF AX = 0 THEN TestHD := false
      ELSE IF AX = 0 THEN TestHD := true;  {Note we really should test
                                            for invalid drive but this
                                            is just an example <g> }
