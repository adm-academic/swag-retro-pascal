 Hi Lou,

 I haven't been following this thread, so I don't know what all has
 been said. I don't have a CD-ROM but I'll toss in some of the info
 that I'm aware of...

 Here is TP source that can detect if one or more CD-ROM is present
 in a PC system, and the drive letter of the first CD-ROM. It tries
 to find if the Microsoft CD-ROM Extension (MSCDEX) is installed...

 The familiar Int21h file i/o can be used for reading files on an
 extended drive.  The MSCDEX also offers the following extended
 functions...

      o Get CD-ROM Drive List
      o Get Copyright Filename
      o Get Abstract Filename
      o Get Bibliographic Filename
      o Read Volume Table of Contents
      o Absolute Disk Read
      o Absolute Disk Write
      o Get CD-ROM Extensions Version
      o Get CD-ROM Units
      o Get or Set Volume Descriptor Preference
      o Get Directory Entry
      o Send Device Request
