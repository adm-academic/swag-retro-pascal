Many people does not think about it, but DOS is limited to report more than
1 gigabyte. Myself I have a 1.3 giga and a 1.0 giga, and made these routines
for my programs for knowing if the size is more than 1 giga. Using the normal
DiskSize and DiskFree could get you strange result, sometimes it could report
maybe 100MB when it is really 1 giga.

If the size og free space is 1 you can assume that the drive is more than 1
gigabyte.}

    ah:=$36; dl:=d; Intr($21,R);
    If AX=$FFFF Then DriveSize:=-1 { Drive not found }
    Else If (DX=$FFFF) or (Longint(ax)*cx*dx=1073725440) Then DriveSize:=1
    Else DriveSize:=Longint(ax)*cx*dx;
  End;
