{RV³ok i would like some info on how to remove a tsr added to memory by a

Mode $10 (ie 640x350x16)
-------------------------

In this mode, the  256K display memory is divided into 4 bit planes of
64K each. Each pixel is produced by 4 bits, one from each bit plane, which
are combined into a 4-bit value that determines which of the 16 colors will
appear on the screen For that pixel.

There is a one-to-one correspondense between the bits in each bit plane and
the pixel on the screen. For example, bit 7 of the first Byte in each bit
plane correspond to the pixel in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

The display memory For the 640x350 Graphics mode is mapped into memory as
a 64K block starting at A000h, With each 64K bit plane occupying the same
address space (ie: in parallel).

Because of the one-to-one relationship of bits in bit planes With the pixels
on the screen, it's straightForward to calculate the address needed to
access a particular pixel. There are 640 bits = 80 Bytes per line on the
screen. Thus the Byte address corresponding to a particular X,Y coordinate
is given by 80*Y + X/8. A desired pixel can then be picked out of the Byte
using the bit mask register.
