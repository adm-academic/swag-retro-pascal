Sorry it took so long - anyway here's a new batch of VGA TRICKS :
First there's your basic equipment - synchronizing with
the vertical Crt retrace.
( You can use this For hardware VGA scrolling synchronisation too, just
substitute the Delay(14) in my old routine For a call to this
Procedure.)

Procedure VRET;Assembler; {works For CGA,EGA and VGA cards}

@Wai: in   AL, DX

The following is Really new, as Far as I know: breaking the color
barrier by displaying more than 64 different colors on a Text mode
screen. (But it will work For Text and Graphics color modes.)
It displays the effect For approximately SEC seconds, affecting
the black background and any black Characters. note that if
you have the border set to black too, the bars will expand into it.
