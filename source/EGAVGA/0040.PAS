Well, you can't lin VGA256.BGI into the program that way; for some
reason, if it wasn't included in TP6 it won't register.  You have
to use the InstallUserDriver function instead of RegisterBGIDriver.
Here is a program that get's into VGA256 mode that way - but of
course you must already know how to do it.

  cmp al,$1A
  jne @ERR     {no VGA Bios}
  cmp bl,7
  jb @ERR      {is VGA or better?}
  cmp bl,$FF

  mov al,1

  VGA256 := InstallUserDriver('VGA256', @DetectVGA256);
  B := 0;
  InitGraph(VGA256, B, '');
  OutText('In 320x200x256 - press enter');
  Readln;
  CloseGraph;
END.
