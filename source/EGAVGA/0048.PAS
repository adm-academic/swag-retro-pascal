> explain MODE X.

Well,  I don't care much about Mode X (which is 320x240x256), but use Mode Y
(=320x200x256)  --at least I think that this mode is called "Mode Y" (as far
as  I  know, the terms were introduced by a series of Michael Abrash in "Dr.
Dobb's  Journal" (?)). Nevertheless, things are identical With the exception
of initialising the VGA card! So here we go; note that the Asm code examples
were taken from my ANIVGA-toolkit: the PASCAL-equivalents when given are "on
the  fly"  Asm->PASCAL  translations  For  improved  clarity (I hope...); in
doubt, rely on the Asm part.

MODE Y in a nutshell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically,  Mode  Y  works  like  this:  use  the BIOS to switch into normal
320x200x256  mode,  then reProgram the sequencer to unchain the 4 bitplanes.
This  results  in  a bitplaned VRAM layout very similiar to the EGA/VGA's 16
color modes:

  or  AL,04

{
CrtAddress  and  StatusReg  are the port addresses For the VGA ports needed;
they  are 3B4h and 3BAh on a monochrome display and 3D4h and 3DAh on a color
display, but can be determined at run-time, too:
}

Asm
  MOV DX,3CCh
  in AL,DX
  TEST AL,1
  MOV DX,3D4h
  JNZ @L1
  MOV DX,3B4h
 @L1:
  MOV CrtAddress,DX
  ADD DX,6
  MOV StatusReg,DX
end;

{
The  VRAM  layout  is  this:  underneath  each  memory  address in the range
$A000:0000..$A000:$FFFF,  there  are  4 Bytes, each representing one pixel's
color.
Whenever you Write to or read from such an address, an internal logic of the
VGA-card determines which one of those 4 pixels is accessed.
A  line  of  320  pixels (=320 Bytes) thus only takes 320/4=80 Bytes address
space,  but  to  address  a pixel, you need a) its VRAM address and b) which
bitplane it's on.
The  pixels  are arranged linearly: thus, the mapping from point coordinates
to memory addresses is done by (x,y) <-> mem[$A000: y*80+ (x div 4)] and the
bitplane is determined by (x mod 4).
(Note coordinates start With 0 and that "div 4" can be computed very fast by
"shr 2"; "mod 4" by "and 3").

So  you  computed the proper address and bitplane. If you want to _read_ the
pixel's color, you issue commands like this:
 portw[$3CE]:=(bitplane SHL 8)+4; color:=mem[$A000:y*80+(x shr 2)]
Or For better speed & control, do it in Asm:

 MOV AL,4
 MOV AH,bitplane
 MOV DX,3CEh
 CLI
 OUT DX,AX
 MOV AL,ES:[DI]
 STI

_Writing_  a pixel's color works similiar, but needs an additional step: the
mask is computed by 1 SHL bitplane (that is: 1/2/4/8 For mod4 values 0/1/2/3
respectively):
 portw[$3C4]:=(1 SHL bitplane+8)+2; mem[$A000:y*80+(x shr 2)]:=color
Or using Asm again:

 MOV CL,bitplane
 MOV AH,1
 SHL AH,CL
 MOV AL,2
 MOV DX,3C4h
 CLI
 OUT DX,AX
 STOSB
 STI

As  stated  above, one address represents 4 pixels, so 320x200 pixels occupy
16000  address  Bytes.  We  do  have  65536  (=$A000:0..$A000:$FFFF) though,
therefore  a  bit  more  than 4 pages are possible. It's up to you to define
your  pages,  0..15999=page  0,  16000..31999=page  1,  32000..47999=page 2,
48000..63999=page 3, 64000..65535=unused  is the most obvious layout.

Which  part  of  the VRAM is actually displayed can be Programmed by writing
the  offset  part of the starting address to the Crt-controller (the segment
part is implicitly set to $A000):

Asm
  MOV DX,CrtAddress
  MOV AL,$0D
  CLI
  OUT DX,AL
  INC DX
  MOV AL,low Byte of starting offset
  OUT DX,AL
  DEC DX
  MOV AL,$0C
  OUT DX,AL
  INC DX
  MOV AL,high Byte of starting offset
  OUT DX,AL
  STI
end;

N.B.: if you reProgram the display's starting address more often than "every
now  and  then",  you  better  synchronize  that  to the vertical retrace or
horizontal  enable  signal  of  your VGA card; otherwise, an annoying screen
flicker will become visible during switching!

For  example,  if  you do a "FOR i:=1 to 100 do SetAddress(i*80)", this will
result  in a blinding fast hardware scroll: With each iteration of the loop,
the  display will start 80 address Bytes (=320 pixels = 1 row) later, giving
the impression of the display scrolling upwards.

Note  that  Mode  X/Y  do  not differ in any other respect than their memory
layouts  from  all  the  other  bitplaned VGA modes: palette handling is the
same,  as  is usage of the VGA's Write modes! In (default) Write mode 0, you
can access the VRAM by Bytes, Words or dWords. Write mode 1 is handy to copy
the  contents  of  one  Graphic  page to another: you are restricted to Byte
accesses, but each one will transfer 4 Bytes at once.
For example, a sequence like the following...
portw[$3C4]:=$0f02; portw[$3CE]:=$4105;
move(mem[$a000:0000],mem[$a000:$3e80],16000);
portw[$3CE]:=$4005
...enables  all 4 planes, switches to Write mode 1, copies the (64000 Bytes)
contents  of  the  2nd Graphic page to the 1st one and then switches back to
Write mode 0 again.
