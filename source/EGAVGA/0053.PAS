function vgaPresent:boolean;assembler;asm
 mov ah,$F; int $10; mov oldMode,al;  {save old Gr mode}
 mov ax,$1A00; int $10;    {check for VGA/MCGA}
 cmp al,$1A; jne @ERR;     {no VGA Bios}
 cmp bl,7; jb @ERR;        {is VGA or better?}
 cmp bl,$FF; jnz @OK;
@ERR: xor al,al; jmp @EXIT;
@OK: mov al,1;
@EXIT:
 end;

otherwise you can check the BIOS save data area for number of rows on
screen... the EGA and VGA keep this updated, older adapters don't (they
set it to 0)

you can just leave the screen in the mode it was in already this way.

var
 lastRow:byte absolute $40:$84;    {newer bios only:rows on screen-1}
