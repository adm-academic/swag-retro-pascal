{
   I cheat a little bit in the way that the screen flickering is handled,
but I find that this way is faster For many animations+palette manipulations /
second While still eliminating screen flickering.  Normally there would be
two tests for retrace, a 'jz' and a 'jnz', instead this only performs the
'jz' test. if your monitor still flickers, uncomment the other code.
