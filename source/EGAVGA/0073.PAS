 Don't think that can be done in normal Text Block Mode.
 But if you flip your Video in Graphics you could always create Display
 Driver to imulate many charactors.
   There is a mode that lets you change one of the Charactor Attribute
 Bits normal use to be used to select a different charactor set, but when
 you do this you also lost that option of what that bit was prior.
 here is the interrupt call
}

Procedure Set512CharSet; Assembler;
Asm
  Mov     AH, 11H;
  Mov     AL, 03H;
  Mov     BL, $12; {Selects the Charactor Sets VIA Bit 3 in Char Attri
  { BL must be loaded so the Video COntroler knows which Block to use }
  { Depending on wether Bit 3 of the Charactor Attri is on of Off }
  { The Upper 4 bits selects a block number to use for The On state of
  { Bit 3, the ,Lower Four Bits Selects the OF State of Bit 3 }
  Int     10H;
End;

{
 So after this, when ever you use TextColor(8 - 15) you will get the
 Next Charactor set, ou lose the Intensity option..
 this means only 7 8 colors. like the Background..
 But you can chage the pallets.
INt 10h
Function 10h
Subfunction 00h
BX = 0712H
INT 10H;
{ Function always loaded in AH reg, Subs in AL. }
