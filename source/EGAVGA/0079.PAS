Don't consider myself that familiar with 'em, but here are some
snippets and remarks. BTW I consider phasing out all BGI stuff in my
code in the first half of '93 or so, which will be a major effort.
After that, I'll rank myself among the register-twiddlers. Maybe we
should team up on this project if you plan on going in that direction
too.

There are several write modes and read modes for EGA/VGA, and the
exact workings of the registers depend on the mode. What you are
talking about (I assume) is read/write mode 0 which you would use
to pump bytes directly into a bit plane. I use the following
procedure for this:

CONST
  GDCIndexReg = $3CE;  { Index register of EGA/VGA Graphics Device Controller }
  GDCDataReg  = $3CF;  { Data  register of EGA/VGA Graphics Device Controller }
  SeqIndexReg = $3C4;  { Index register of EGA/VGA Sequencer }
  SeqDataReg  = $3C5;  { Data  register of EGA/VGA Sequencer }

PROCEDURE PrepareBitPlaneRead(Plane: Byte);
  BEGIN
    Port[GDCIndexReg] := 5;           { Number of Mode register }
    Port[GDCDataReg ] := 0;           { Value of register: 0: read mode 0 }
    Port[GDCIndexReg] := 4;           { Number of Read Map Select register }
    Port[GDCDataReg ] := Plane;       { Value of register: bit for plane to
read }
  END; { PrepareBitPlaneRead }

    Port[GDCDataReg ] := $10;         { Value of register: 10: default for
modes 10h and 12h }

    Port[GDCDataReg ] := 0;           { Value of register: plane to read }

A good explanation can be found in:
  Wilton,R - Programmers' guide to PC and PS/2 video systems
  Microsoft Press

You should invest in some books on EGA/VGA programming if you have
more of these questions, otherwise you're being 'penny wise, pound
foolish'.

The book by Wilton is considered more or less a 'must have' together
with
  Ferraro, R.F. - Programmer's guide to the EGA and VGA cards
  Addison-Wesley

Ferraro gives you detailed register info. It also deals with Super
VGAs. Because I'll have to expand a program to use VESA super VGA
modes, I bought this together with:
  Rimmer, S - Super VGA graphics programming secrets
  WindCrest/McGraw Hill
