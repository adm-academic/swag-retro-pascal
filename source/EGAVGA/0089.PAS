Here you go...  It will work on all computers.  I do not use the 286
string instructions, as they go too fast for some VL-Bus video cards causing
incorrect colours.  The first part waits for a full vertical retrace
before changing the colours to prevent "snow" at the top of the display on
slower computers.  The only time you'll see the snow is if you continuously
get or set the palette such as in a screen fade.
