
{OK...for awhile I've been saying I'm going to post my unit for changing
characters...well today's the day.  This unit has one procedure called
ProcessChar.  You pass ProcessChar the ordinal value of the character
you wish to process (between 0 and 255), the data that holds your new
character or where you want to load the existing character, and if you
want to load it or save it.  There are also four constants that simulate
a copyright symbol.  One is bigger than the other (that's the only
difference).  You can replace characters with the copyright symbol so
effectively you can have a legal C-in-a-circle in text mode!!  Although,
I do not know if this is actually legal, so don't mark my words... }
