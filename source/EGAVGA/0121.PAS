(cleared). It's all IBM's fault. You see, there is also a change in
resolution and available colors and how video is used. It totally changes
and that's a way of life on the PC. Sorry, no way around it but to use
full graphics mode.

 FA> if you want to have a look <grin>)

320 x 200 x 256c, 13h, isn't the same as the resolution required for 80x50
text (640 x 400 x 256). In that case, I have seen graphics (simple) under
text in text mode. If you're forced to change resolution, kiss it all good
bye.
