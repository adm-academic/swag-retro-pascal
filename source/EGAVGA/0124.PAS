Ok, I played around with it a bit today, and following is my modified
version.  I pretty much just cleaned it up, got rid of all the unused
variables and stuff (there were quite a few <G>) for readability,
simplified a the calculations, and removed a lot of the overhead, and
removed most of the global variables.  You will see that now you can
have a lot more snowflakes without it bogging out.  I also removed the
custom palette because you can get pretty much the same colours using
the default palette (indexes 19-31).  It can probably be simplified
even further (ie. remove the x and y tables and just use newPos table).
Oh yeah, I threw in a little snowflake explosion at the start too :-).
