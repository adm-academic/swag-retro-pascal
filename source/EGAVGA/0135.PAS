well, Ystart is needed basically because I'm using two pages, and depending
on which page is visible at the time, ystart varies...

ok, but this doesn't solve my problem...  my problem is that I always get to
'see' the wrong colors - I don't mind which error codes there are :-))

sure, but 640x480x16 still is a normal VGA and not a VESA mode:
}

PROCEDURE plot_640x480x16; ASSEMBLER;
ASM
  MOV ES, SEGA000
  MOV DI, px
  MOV CX, DI
  SHR DI, 3
  MOV AX, py
  SHL AX, 4
  ADD DI, AX
  SHL AX, 2
  ADD DI, AX
  AND CL, $07
  MOV AH, $80
  SHR AH, CL
  MOV AL, $08
  MOV DX, $03CE
  OUT DX, AX
  MOV AX, pc
  MOV AH, [ES:DI]
  MOV [ES:DI], AL
END;

{
this should work (as always: px,py are the coordinates and pc is the color
(all global INTEGERs)
}
