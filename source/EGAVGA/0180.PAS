Here's something I was working on... It's been a while since I touched
these but they work perfectly on my video (ATI/XL24/VESA 1.2). It takes
about 2 seconds to do a full 640x480 (VESA 101) on my 386DX/33.

I'm not sure if it will work on your system and I think it will work
only with window granularity of 64K. Please tell me if it works with
yours, and what granularity is 101 using on your system.

You will have to switch to protected mode to do that. If you just want
to store memory above 1meg, and not access specific parts of it (for
memory viewers, etc.), you can use EMS, XMS or switch over to BP7's
DPMI/protected mode.
