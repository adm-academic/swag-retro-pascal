Ok, if you are trying to find the segment in text mode, it's real easy..
here is a function...
}

function GetVPage : word;
asm
  mov BX,$B000;  { Default is monochrome segment      }
  mov AH,$0F;    { Bios function 0Fh : Get Video Mode }
  int $10;       { Do a Bios video interrupt          }
  cmp AL,$07;    { Are we in monochrome?              }
  je @@Done;     { Yes, then jump                     }
  mov BX,$B800;  { Set it to the color segment        }
 @@Done:
  mov AX,BX;     { Return the value in AX             }
end;
