I'm not to sure what the rule is for posting code on here but I figured
a few of the new programmer, maybe even some of the older ones would
enjoy this little program I whipped up.  (finally got my screen 12
putpixel working... grrrrr).  Annoying when every odd color rotates the
bits and doesn't carry. :)  Anyone have a smaller routine :)
