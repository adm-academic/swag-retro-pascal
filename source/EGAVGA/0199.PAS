I know I can't do that, never mind about the rest. At the moment I'm
working on some scrolling in xmode 320x200 resolution. Things are going
pretty good so far, and I'm planning to port it to the vesa 640x480
resolution later. For my algorithm I would have to set the virtual
screen size to approx. 1300 pixels wide. That could result in as much as
480 / (64k / 1300) = 10 bank-switches per frame. (That's 700
bank-switches per second in a worst case situation)

I did some simple testing:
}

program TestBank;

uses
  Dos, crt;

const
  gran = 64;

var
  clock : longint absolute $0:$046c;
  counter, ticks : longint;
  rp : registers;

procedure vio(ax:word);         {INT 10h reg ax=AX. other reg. set from RP
                                 on return rp.ax=reg AX}
begin
  rp.ax:=ax;
  intr($10,rp);
end;

procedure viop(ax,bx,cx,dx:word;p:pointer);
begin                            {INT 10h reg AX-DX, ES:DI = p}
  rp.ax:=ax;
  rp.bx:=bx;
  rp.cx:=cx;
  rp.dx:=dx;
  rp.di:=ofs(p^);
  rp.es:=seg(p^);
  intr($10,rp);
end;

procedure SetBank( bank : word);
begin
  rp.bx:=0;
  bank:=bank*longint(64) div gran;
  rp.dx:=bank;
  vio($4f05);
  rp.bx:=1;
  rp.dx:=bank;
  vio($4f05);
end;

begin
  viop($4f02, $101, 0, 0, nil); { 640x480x256 }

  for counter := 0 to 15 do
  begin
    setbank( counter);
    fillchar( mem[$a000:0], 65535, counter+1);
  end;

  counter := 0;
  ticks := clock;
  repeat
    setbank( counter mod 16);
    inc( counter);
  until clock = ticks+90;

  viop($4f02, 3, 0, 0, nil);

  writeln(counter div 5, ' bank-switches/sec.');
  writeln('= ', 5000/counter : 6 : 4, ' msec / switch');
end.

{
and I get 0.0642 msec/switch with TLIVESA
and 0.0622 msec/switch with Univesa 3.2 (both vesa 1.2)

I think that's fast enough not to make me worry too much. That is,
unless you know of some cards that do bank-switching extremely slow.

All sounds good to me. I would like to see a demo and/or the interface
section of some units!
