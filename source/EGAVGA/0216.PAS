Well, a while ago I wrote one of these that seems to work real well...
I just spent a half-hour or so doing it, because the only ones I had
were in future crew type demos, and I wanted a screen saver one... Here
ya' go:

Here's a program I've been working on a little lately--It shows
a 3D star field with 256 colors used.  I haven't seen this particular
type of star program anywhere outside of demos and things, and I thought
it might be helpful.  I haven't had time to really optimize it yet,
and it is pretty math-intensive, so it's not the fastest thing in the
world (even though it's a little too fast on my 486dx2/66 =|).
You can shange most of the variables in the program for different
effects--Things like the maximum stars and stuff.  I am running TP7, and
I have not tried this with other versions, but it should work fine
as far as I know.
