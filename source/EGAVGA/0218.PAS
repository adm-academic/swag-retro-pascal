{
I see so many messages of people wanting help on drawing in Mode 13H
So mayB we can start a thread here for people that know as little as myself.

Following is a complete program to place you in Mode 13H and to draw an
object 100 times.

My knowledge of ASM is very limited so mayB you would like to make some
suggestions on how to do this faster & also how I should keep the object
in memory in stead of using an array.
BUT, for the beginners this should be a good start - I hope ??

   X,Y,I    : Integer;

    ASM
      mov   ah,0
      mov   al,13H
      int   10h
    END
  End;
