Procedure ChgPage(page : integer);
Begin
  Asm
    mov ax,$4F05
    mov bx,0
    mov dx,page
    int $10
  End;
  currpage := page;
End;

The above is the VESA standard for changing pages.  DOS only allocates 64k of
memory to the video, so to access the full 265k of info, you must switch
between 5 different pages to access all the memory.  This isn't the most
efficient procedure considering that it has an int 10h, but at least it will
get you started.
