  I'm having some trouble with a VESA SVGA interface I'm writing.
  As if you had nothing better to do :), I have included my source below.
It is supposed to make use if the VESA save/restore state function of
int $10, function $4F04.  The idea is that I have written one "layer" of
procedures which are simple BIOS interfaces, and they begin with "B".
Then there is the more advanced layer, which doesn't.  Most of the functions
work OK, but this one I can't figure out.  If you can see the problem, great.
If you want more details, mail me at doylep@ecf.utoronto.ca.

  Thanks for any help.  Here's the source:
