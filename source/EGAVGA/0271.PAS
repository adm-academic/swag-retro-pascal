                  *FAST* Turbo Pascal unit (part assembly langauge).

  DESCRIPTION:

  Saves a copy of the 640x480 VGA 16 color screen to a properly
  formatted PCX file.  This routine also takes care to save
  the current palette so your colors will be preserved correctly.


  REQUIRED:

  *  Turbo Pascal 6+ to run these routines, however, if you just want
     to learn the PCX format you can read the source code and comments.
     I think Pascal code is a relatively easy language to read and
     understand.

  *  EGAVGA.BGI supplied by Borland with the Turbo Pascal compiler


  FILE LIST:

  vga2pcx.pas    Source code for pcx routines
  vga2pcx.tpu    Turbo Pascal 6.0 object code
  test.pas       Example program to use the vga2pcx unit
  test.exe       Compiled example program
  test.pcx       PCX file created by test.exe program


  COMMON USES:

  *  Programmer can give user ability to save a copy of his/her
     exact graphics screen for presentation or documentation purposes.
     The PCX format is common format that is easily imported into
     word processors, etc.

  *  Slide show programs often operate on PCX files.  You can save
     a sequence of pictures and then run a program to cycle through
     them like a demonstration.

  *  Frees the DOS programmer from having to support multiple
     printing devices.  If you can fit your graphics on the screen,
     the screen can be saved into a standard PCX file.  This opens
     the door to printing via other, more specialized, programs.

  *  Source code included, so you can learn the PCX format and
     customize for your own use.

  If you find these functions useful, I'd appreciate to hear from you.
  If you feel like supporting my efforts, be great too.  Some people
  have sent me mail telling me that we've been waiting for these routines
  for years.  I suggest $5, but you can send me whatever you think is

   *** compression idea:

      Each scanline is decomposed into a continous stream of 4 bit planes
      = 80 bytes * 4 = 320 bytes.  This stream is checked for consecutive
      byte patterns.  Up to 63 ($3F) values can compressed into two bytes
      forming a RLE code of $C0 or'ed with the run length (up to $3F). This
      forms the first byte, usually ($FF = 1100 0000 | 0011 1111)  The
      next byte is the actual data byte.  If a single byte is encountered
      it is written to the file as simply itself UNLESS the top two
      bits are set (mask $C0) which would indicate a RLE.  If this is
      the case then a special RLE of length 1 must be written in the
      general RLE form.  Here this would be ($C0 | 01 => $C1 followed
      by the data byte.).  I compress each scan line separately thus ending
      possible RLE's at the end of each scan line.  This seems to be
      accepted practice.
