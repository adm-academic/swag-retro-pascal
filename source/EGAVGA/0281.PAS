Well.  if you want to make a 320x200x256 game, I know the right stuff.  if you
would like to make the Character centered, and when you press
up/down/left/right, the whole screen scrolls.  Here is an example on a playing
field that is umm.  Let's say 1000x200 (200K).

  Well.  That's it.  It actually took me 20 minutes to Type this whole thing
