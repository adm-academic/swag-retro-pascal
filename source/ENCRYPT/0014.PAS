³ Is if possible For you to post a sample code on how to use xor to
³ encrypt a File???   I'm shifting ORD value around to do excryptions
³ and I think your method is better..  So I would like to learn it..

Sure, here's a simple example that reads a user-entered line and
encrypts it using the xor method.  By XOR-ing it again the line is
decrypted.  This won't keep NSA fooled For more than a few seconds, but
so long as you keep the passWord hidden it should suffice.
