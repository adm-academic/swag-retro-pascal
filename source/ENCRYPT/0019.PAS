  Here is basically the same function again.  However note the
  RandSeed assignment - RandSeed is set to the length of the
  string before a string is processed.  Since the length of
  the string never changes, you can randomly pick any string
  and be able to decrypt it.  RandSeed is used to make Random
  return a specific sequence of psuedo-random numbers, and
  this encryption method relies on the same sequence in order
  for it to decrypt.

  PROCEDURE EnDecrypt(VAR S: String);
  VAR
    X: Byte;
  BEGIN
    RandSeed := Length(S);
    FOR X := 1 TO Length(S) DO
      S[X] := Chr(Ord(S[X]) XOR (Random(128) OR 128));
  END;

  VAR
    S: String;
  BEGIN
    Write('Enter a string: ');
    Readln(S);
    EnDecrypt(S);
    WriteLn;
    WriteLn;
    Writeln('The encrypted string is ', S);
    EnDecrypt(S);
    WriteLn;
    WriteLn;
    Writeln('The decrypted string is ', S);
  END.
