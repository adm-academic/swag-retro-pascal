    This program has been written to demonstrate the coding and decoding
    of a file.

    SYNTAX:   codechal password1 password2 infile outfile

    All four parameters are required.
    The passwords are case sensitive.

    Whilst this program was written purely for the purposes of a challenge
    issued in the Oz Pascal echo, it would not be difficult to upgrade it to
    a commercial grade encryption/decryption utility - there several very
    simple changes to enhance the security of the cypher output. As written it
    will only encrypt or decrypt the first 4096 bytes of a file.  If you wish
    to use the code here as a basis for a commercial product, contact the
    author for details.

    Some may scoff at its simplicity; I say; solve the challenge, then you
    will have the right to call it simple.  You have the tools, this source
    code gives the full details of the encrypting/decrypting algorithm used.
