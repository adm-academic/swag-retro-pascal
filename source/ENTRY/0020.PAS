To achieve this, you have to prog your own ReadLine-procedure, using
the READKEY and KEYPRESSED functions of TP.
You can't get READLN() to do the job for you. You have to do it your
own. :-)

Here is an example of what an Input-Line routine could look like:
It's only a small one. I also have a much more comfortable one, but it
isn't finished yet. :-)))
