   This Program will execute a program within a text window
   and all program scrolling will be maintained within
   the window.

   This would be better to put inside a unit, but I couldn't get the
   interrupt to work within the unit.  If you're able to get it to work
   inside a unit, I would appreciate you posting the unit so I can see
   how it was done.

  NOTE: The window size for the executed program will actually be two
        rows and two columns smaller that what you call.  This is because
        there is no error checking to see if the call will place the
        window borders outside the maximum row column range for the
        video.                                                           }

{ Now set the text window so the program will not scroll the outline of

{ I would like to modify this code to allow for a screen save feature that
  will restore the previous screen for the coordinates passed to the ExecWin
  function.
  Other nice features would be to add a sideways scrolling effect,
  exploding windows for the text window and then make it implode when
  the previous video is restored. }
