 Batch files are interpreted by the COMMAND.COM, or NDOS.COM etc.  They
can not be run by any interrupt.

 The structure of an .exe header is:
}
  exehdr = record
    sig: array[1..2] of Char; { 4Dh, 5Ah signature (sometimes 5Ah, 4Dh) }
    rem512,         { image size remainder (program size mod 512, not including header)}
    pages,          { number of 512-byte pages needed to hold .EXE file (incl header)}
    RelocSize,      { number of relocation items}
    hsize,          { header size in paragraphs}
    minextra,       { minimum extra paragraphs needed}
    maxextra,       { maximum extra paragraphs needed}
    SSeg,           { stack segment}
    SOfs,           { stack offset}
    chksum: Word;   { word checksum of entire file}
    Entry: Pointer; { initial CS:IP}
    Reloc,          { offset of relocation table}
    Overlay: Word;  { overlay number}
    Junk: array[$1c..$3b] of Byte;
    New_Exe_Ofs: LongInt;
  end;
