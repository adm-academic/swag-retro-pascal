versions by commenting these two lines, but at your own risk!

INTERFACE

FUNCTION  Trap:Boolean; FAR;
{* Returns False on installation.
 * After trapping a runtime error it jumps back to where the function was
   called returning True.
 * The procedure that calls Trap must NOT return as long as Trap is installed
   (so it is safest to call Trap from the main program, if possible)!
 * You must call this function AFTER installing all other Exitprocs (if any).
 * In Real mode: You must NOT call it from an overlayed unit.
 * In Protected mode and Windoze: You must call it from a code segment with
   the following attributes: FIXED PRELOAD PERMANENT. (I am not sure if this
   is really necessary...).}
