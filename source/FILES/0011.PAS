  l := FileSize(f);         { Get File size }
  r.di := l and $ffff;      { Devide File size to most/least parts }
  r.si := l div $10000;     { For locking the entire File.         }

  LockFile := ((r.flags and 1)=0);
  { if carry flag is set File locking failed, reason in AX }

{
BTW: to unlock it use the same routine, but change the  r.al to 1.

if this routine fails, it means that the File is locked in the other
task, and cannot be used.
