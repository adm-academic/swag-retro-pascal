I just ran some timings, which are gonna be affected by SMARTDRV.EXE
being loaded, but I took that into account (ran multiple times on same
file, and took timings on second/subsequent runs, to make sure always
got cache hits)

What I got was that FileExists below and my modified version of that
fileExist3 function that's been floating around this echo for a while
(no bug) both run neck and neck... it's amazing... both are slightly
faster than FileExist2 and lots lots faster than the 'reset,
fileExist=(ioresult=0)' type thing that most people still seem to use...

I'd recommend using the first one below as it's really short...

  findfirst(s, anyfile, r);
