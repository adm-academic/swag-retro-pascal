The FileMode byte reserves certain bits to specify different capabilities.
They are:

76543210
--------
.....000  - Read access
.....001  - Write access
.....010  - Read/write access
....0...  - Reserved - must be zero
.000....  - Sharing mode - compatibility mode ["no sharing"?]
.001....  - Sharing mode - read/write access denied
.010....  - Sharing mode - write access denied
.011....  - Sharing mode - read access denied
.100....  - Sharing mode - full access permitted
0.......  - Inherited by child processes
1.......  - Private to current process

I got this out of a pocket DOS/BIOS reference -- hope it helps.
