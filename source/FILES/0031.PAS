Subj: FileSize in DOS                Conf: (232) T_Pascal_R

The FileSize "returns the number of components" in a file.  Thus, it
may not work as you might assume on untyped files, or files of records.

The file should be declared as a file of byte or char or as a text
file, in order to use FileSize.

An alternative to FileSize is to use the SearchRec type in the DOS
unit.  This program deletes a file if it is 0 bytes.  The filespec is
provided by the user on the command line, and can contain wildcards.
