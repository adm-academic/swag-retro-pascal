Program KillChar;

{ Written by Tom Carroll and released to the public domain
  on 12/11/93.

 This program will read any file and delete any characters passed on
  the command line.

  For example:  KillChar InFile OutFile ASCII Value (of character)

         i.e.:  KILLCHAR MYFILE.TXT NEWFILE.TXT 12

  This will remove all form feeds from a text file.

  No error control is included.
