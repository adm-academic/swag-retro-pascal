 In order to change a files date/timestamp you'll have open the file
 whether you use the TP SetFTime routine or use Int 21h Function 5701
 BUT by Opening it for reading you can change it to whatever you want.
 If you open it for writing then the TimeStamp will automatically be
 changed to whatever the time was when you closed it.

 Here's a little demo that changes the files timestamp to whatever the
 current time is:
 (NOTE this does not test for existance of the file before settingthe time.)}
