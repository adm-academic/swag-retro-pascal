Refrain from using the old-style file access methods, i.e, those using
FCB's. Not only are they "frowned upon" by Microsoft, worse: they can
only work with files located in the current directory.
Use the file handle methods instead.

Perhaps it would be interesting to see which method is fastest.

The ONLY situation in which you absolutely must use FCBs is setting the
volume label on a disk.
