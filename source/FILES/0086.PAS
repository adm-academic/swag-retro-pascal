There's actually a typo in release 47 of the list, as I've found out this
evening while trying to handle these in BP (hence the cross-post to
comp.lang.pascal.borland).

Here's my BP code for a little program that prints both the short and
long version of any longnamed file on C:.  it'll be pretty similar in Delphi,
if the INT 21 approach is what you're supposed to use in Win16.
