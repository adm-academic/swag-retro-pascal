Here's the code.  Don't worry about the structure of it.  I know it is bad but
this was a quick and dirty little util I wrote up that I needed.  Have fun With
it and try to speed it up.  And whoever else wants to help have fun!

I hope this compiles I took out some stuff that would display a little picture
of a sWord and show the version and product name.  I also tried DJ's idea of
the buffer of 65535 but it said the structure was too large. So I used 64512.
