I imported it, but couldn't get it to work (several problems in the
source) and in the process of getting it to work (for one thing I didn't
know what it was supposed to accomplish in the first place) I added a
few things to it and this probably isn't what you wanted it to look like
but it wouldn't be hard to do now that it's in TP-acceptable form.

I also added one other small palette flipper that's kind of neat.

  okay, Colors is a pointer to the variable array of
  colours to use (6bit rgb values to pump to the dac)
  Lines is the number of scanlines on the screen (for syncing)
  RegNum is the colour register (DAC) to use.
  valid values are 0-255. that should explain that one.
  Count is the number of cycles updates to do before it exits.
