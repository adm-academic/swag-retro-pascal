Um, have a look at this, and see what you can come up with. It's some code I
wrote a while back to use mode-x and do double buffering (or page-flipping).
}

Program Test_ModeX;

Uses
  crt;


{ This program will put the VGA card into a MODEX mode (still only 320x200)
  and demonstrate double buffering (page flipping)

  This program was written by Mark Dixon, and has been donated to the
  Public Domain with the exception that if you make use of these routines,
  the author of these routines would appreciate his name mentioned somewhere
  in the documentation.

  Use these routines at your own risk! Because they use the VGA's registers,
  cards that are not 100% register compatible may not function correctly, and
  may even be damaged. The author will bear no responsability for any actions
  occuring as a direct (or even indirect) result of the use of this program.
