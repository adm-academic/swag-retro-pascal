I've been playing around with it as a way to make 'heat-seeking
missiles' in games. Very interesting...

What I do is have the points set up as follows:

1   : current position
2&3 : current speed + the current position
4   : destination

and update current position by indexing somewhere into the curve (like
at $100 out of $FFFF

This works very well. Problem is that I don't know of a good way to
change the speed.

Here is a simple demo that makes a dot chase the mouse cursor (needs
VGA as written) that shows what I mean.

If ANYBODY can make this work smoother or improve on it in any way I
would appreciate being told how... 8)
