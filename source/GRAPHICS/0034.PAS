I wrote this Program For a friend to read a image into his Program, and
and I would be happy For any help on how to improve it.

Program  Read_Image;      { SRC-CODE.PAS   ver 1.00 }
{-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Program reads in a binary data File, and displays the image on the screen by
 using "PutPixel" Procedure in the Graph Unit.  The image can be displayed in
 color, or in grey-scale by using the subroutine "Set64Gray" below.
 This is a quick and dirty method to display the image using "PutPixel",
 and I hope someone will be able to show us how to use the "PutImage" to
 display the image quicker.

 The fragment below will initialize the first 64 VGA color values to
 gray scale.  These colors are valid For any VGA mode (including Text),
 but in most Graphics modes/devices the Borland Graph Unit limits you
 to using only 16 colors.
