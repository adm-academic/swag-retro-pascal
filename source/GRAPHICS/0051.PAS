the slope method is a close cousin to bubble-sort an algorithm to use if
you can't be bothered to use a more efficient one for the job.

here's one. that only uses addition and subtraction in it's loop.
(FWIW it's based on the commutativity of multiplication.)

I think It's got some fancy name which I forget, this code is 100% my
own (freeware) and reasonably well tested.
