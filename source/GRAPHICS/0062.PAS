I don't want to give it all away, but I just made some Shaded-bobs (or
whatever). It realy isn't difficult. It worked right away. Now YOU make a nicer
sin-curve and palette. Here's some source:

{ DrawSprite procedure taken from Sean Palmer (again).
  It contained some minor bugs: [X] was added to AX, should be DI, and
  jz @S was jnz @S, so the sprite wasn't drawn. Now it is...
  And of course it was changed to INCREASE the video-mem, not to poke it.

  If you get rid of the Retrace it goes a LOT faster. }
