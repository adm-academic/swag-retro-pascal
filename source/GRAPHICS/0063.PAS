I'll try. I notice you're using memory variables for loop counters in that
code. Also seem to be reloading the segment registers each time through the
loop, and general sundry pushes, pops, and such which are unnecesary. I don't
have time to rewrite your code from scratch today but I'll post my transparent
bitmap routine for Mode 13 for you to use/learn from. K?

this is untested, I was fixing it up after I found it my optimization gets
better over time, and it's been a while since I've worked on this Mode 13h
stuff.

And I'll bet you notice a difference in speed with this puppy. 8)

If you could guarantee that the width would be an even number you could
optimize it to use word moves, otherwise it wouldn't be worth it.
