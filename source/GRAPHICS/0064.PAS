i added into code some quick'n'dirty comments to let you understand
how assembly works. i've tested this code and found that it won't work with
Microsoft's workgrp.sys driver - the programm simply crashes when you press a
key. (workgrp.sys driver is one of the Windows for Workgroups drivers).
strange... with all other things (qemm386, lan drivers etc.) programm seems to
work fine. one more thing i must add that better is to pass to procedure
putsprite not array with sprite's data but only pointer to it - because tp
moves all this data around memory - and in this case it's 256 bytes.
