yes i realize it works out real nice with 256x256 bitmaps, because you can
shift/carry or whatever to get the particular point in the bitmap you want
easily.

yes it uses 32 bit instructions, but since it's so short, it's not a problem
coding it in BASM.. and here it is:

try, although i was disappointed that they didn't really do much new (those
blue bolls were nice though, although they flickered quite alot.. but hey! i'm
hardly paying for the demo, am i!)

but yeah, the voxel stuff was nice.. after reciving email from Lord Logics (of
Avalanche), he says that he's been working on some voxel stuff, although he
didn't get it finished because of getting a job, although he intends to finish
it and release it in a demo for avalanche.. so that'd be nice to see..

tell me if the code is efficent or not! :-)

No, you don't have to do diddly squat to extract it. Just move the byte out.
Since one's in the hi byte of a 32-bit register though, it's harder to extract.

Of course you know that BP 7.0 won't do 386 instructions. So this wouldn't
compile as is. Needs a lot of DB $66's, etc.

Yep. I haven't coded it up where it'll compile and run it yet, but Should Be
Pretty Darn Quick. Seems like it's gonna have a problem with the carry from dx
to the hi word of edx (your position will be off, barely, every time it
wraps.... shouldn't matter much)

I'm gonna have to code something like that up for a BattleTech type game. Best
idea I've seen so far for terrain... If you see any code to get me started,
please route it my way.

> tell me if the code is efficent or not! :-)

Only one optimization I can spot right now (aside from coding the outer loop in
ASM as well...) Is that he has to shift the 32-bit registers around to get at
the upper word. (the 386 needs more data registers!!!!!! ARE YOU LISTENING
INTEL!!!) So using the SHLD instruction like I re-coded above should speed it
up some. Avoid the intermediate register move.

I've commented above. You could put alot of the setup stuff outside the loop if
you wrote it all in BASM. Wouldn't have to push/pop for each scan line, etc.
But that's a minor speedup.

In the future, try to gain access to the FIDO 80XXX echo. It's a much better
place to talk about (mostly) assembly stuff.
