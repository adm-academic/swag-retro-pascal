Hello Bas!

Yes, I got it today... basically the problem I saw with the code was lack of
optimization and it also looked like you were trying to do too much. You
didn't need all the asm. But it could be even faster if you included it. I'm
sending back my modified version of your DYCP program. The "writecharasm"
procedure was screwed up so I removed it and I will check it out at a later
time. I modified the "writechar" procedure which you had commented out.
