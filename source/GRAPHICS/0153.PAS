> How do I set a pixel in that mode (800x600x256) ?

If the computer has a VESA driver installed, you can do it the same as you
would for 320x200 (13h).  You would first change the video mode to the
correct one and then plot the point.  The trouble is that every video card
has different mode numbers for the different modes.

   Ploting a Pixel
   ---------------

     To plot a pixel you would use the following Pascal Procedure:
}

Procedure Plot(x,y:integer; color:byte); assembler;
Asm
  mov bh,0
  mov cx,x { sets x coordinate }
  mov dx,y { sets y coordinate }
  mov al,color { sets color (0-255) }
  mov ah,0Ch { tells video to plot a point }
  int 10h
End;

{
The x coordinate is moved into cx, the y coordinate is moved into dx and
the color is moved into al.  You must make sure that color is a BYTE
variable.  It can go from 0-255.  When you pass the color, it either must
be from a byte variable or it must be 'variable mod 256' (where
'variable' is some integer type variable).

This example uses inline assembler.  To do anything significant with the SVGA
you either have to use assembler or find a good BGI file or unit that will do
it for you.
