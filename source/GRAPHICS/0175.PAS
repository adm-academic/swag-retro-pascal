>Can someone post code for drawing a circle in Mode-X?

Here is a Circle procedure that will work in all Graphic modes (it's
even pretty fast...), as long as you have a putpixel procedure that
works.  It only works up until a radius of 50 or so, after that holes
start appearing.  I know why it happens, but I'm too lazy to fix it.

(This code is just cut and pasted from other units, so I have not
tested it.  It should work though...).
