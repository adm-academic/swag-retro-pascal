The docs for SetRGBPalette are very confusing.  The ColorNum variable
is not the first 16 palette entries.  Borland's 16 color Palette is
mapped into the VGA 256 color Palette.  The below constant ColorMap
defines the mapping.

const  ColorMap : array[0..15] of word =  {256 to 16 color palette mapping}
         (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 7, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63);

  For example: The 15th color in Borland's Palette is really the 63th color
               in the VGA Palette.

I reason this was done was to have the standard 16 colors without having to
modify the default VGA palette.  Here is a sample program that changes
the Palette for VGA mode.  It draws color bars for the 16 colors, then
changes the Palette to gray shades.  Press any key between changes and
to exit the program.  Enjoy.
