I don't know how fast your is, but the following code is pretty darn fast.
It may actually be just as fast as a regular putimage because it doens't have
to send black colors to the vid memory.  There are a couple words of warning,
however.  The following code will only work for 320x200x256 mode and was
written with a specific getimage format in mind.  The format is simple
(xsize:word,ysize:word,image data), but may be different than TP's getimage.
It's all nice and confusing assembler, but it does work effectively.
One last thing: CurBuf is the location of where the image is to be sent.  If
you want it sent to the vidmem, set CurBuf := ptr($A000,$0);

Procedure PutTransparent(x, y : integer; ImagePtr : pointer; tcolor : byte);

{ Similar to PutImage, but if the color is tcolor, it is not plotted }

var
  Addr : word;
  cols : word;
  bcolor : byte;

begin
  Addr := x + (y shl 8) + (y shl 6);
