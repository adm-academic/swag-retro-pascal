No, I have made many tests ( 3 hours spending on it ) and my results are :
First : The Procedure relative to the main programm has NO affect one the
preformance ( atleast with small programms ).
My System look like this :
        486 DX 50 with 256 kb Cache
        ISA ET4000 W32 VGA-Card
        16 MB RAM

Sorry, but when I was testing the routines I had set N to 1000 !!! That
should be big enough.. Well since Jannie Hanekom wrote me a message, I made
again some test and these are my results :

 ( numbers have no meaning, higher is better ,  N = 1000 )
 pix1 :   59,68 M  ( Mem in Pascal )
 pix2 :  158,00 M  ( with lookup table, old proc )
 pix3 :  170,35 M  ( without lookup table )
 pix4 :  186,37 M  ( with lookup table, NEW proc )
 pix5 :  153,31 M  ( with lookup table, optimized by Jannie Hankom
                     trying to reduce penalty cycles, while Memory access )
 pix6 :  213,57 M  ( with lookup table, from Jannie Hanekom,
                     optimized by me )
     { M = Million }

Jannie Hanekom said correctly, if a register is changed one cycle befor a
memory move is made with this register, the processor will make one penalty
cycle to calculate the adress. So you must always try to do such a thing :

  add  bx, cx                   { calc offset to pixel in Mem }
  mov  al, C                    { do some thing else, so the processor can
                                  calc the offset in Mem }
  mov  byte ptr es:[bx], al     { Now you wont get a penalty cycle, because
                                  you have changed bx 2 cycles befor the
                                  Mem move !! }

If you would use this code, you WOULD get a penalty cycle :
  mov  al, C
  add  bx, cx
  mov  byte ptr es:[bx], al
Because you have changed the bx one cycle befor the mem move..

It would be very interessting to know which results you get on your
computer, because pix6 is now the FASTEST routine to put a pixel in
320x200x256 !! Try these thing with N = 1000, so you wont get much
diffrents between two tests..

BTW, if you have found any faster routines, let me know !!!! I'm realy
interessted in this !!
