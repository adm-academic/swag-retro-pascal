{
A couple of months ago, I posted an unfinished procedure to move a row of
pixels one pixel to the left and asked for help. Didn't get any response
(pretty normal, since it's really a lot of work to figure out someone else's
assembler code :), but in the meantime I've been able to finish it. Don't know
whether there's still anybody out there who can use it (the original
requester, Fabian Thylman(n?), seems to have left Fidonet), but here it is
anyway...

PROCEDURE MoveRow1PixelLeft(x,y, length: WORD; VAR tempbuf);
{For Mode-X, 320*200*4. Moves length pixels at (x,y) one position to the
left.}{Tempbuf should be an array of byte/char, with size = length div 4.
