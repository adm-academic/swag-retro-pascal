Display a shape at a given position on screen, over the current

          shape's edge is transparent)

          X and Y are presumed ALWAYS valid : i.e. Within bounds of
          screen; Also, it is presumed that the sprite is not placed
          in a position on screen that over runs the screen borders:
          unexpected effects would occur. Sorry! Use ClipBlit if you
          must place sprites in the screen border.

PCX LOAD AND SAVE ROUTINES - WHICH WORK
***************************************

{
This will put a mode 13h 256 colour PCX at position X,Y and
show a defined area. Useful for low res multimedia applications. :-)
This PCX loader can handle PCX's of variable dimensions up to
width 320 and height 200 so you could design sprites
with a graphics package and save them as a PCX then grab them
off the screen as Shapes. Also, this PCX loader is far faster than
Norman Yen's effort and intelligently uses memory. (Note: How can
a program dumbly use memory? Hmm?)

Expects: Filename is an MS-DOS filespec relating to the PCX's name,
         i.e. 'C:\WORK\SHEEP.PCX' (Oh well explained Scott :^( )
         ThePalette is a PaletteType record used to hold the PCX's
         palette data.
         X,Y specifies the top left coordinates on screen of where
         the PCX is to be drawn. X should be in the range of 0 to
         319, Y should be in the range of 0 to 199. The picture
         will be clipped as necessary.

Returns: Your program will halt with an error message if the PCX file
         does not exist, or if the PCX is not of the correct "type".
         (I.E. It's not mode 13h or it's not 256 colour etc.).

At this point one element of data has been read, and stored in
variable C. If bits 6 & 7 of C are set then this means to the system
a "run of bytes" has been found. (i.e. a number sequence - for example,
four 1's, twenty 15's, any sequence of identical numbers).

In this case, the 6 least significant bits of C indicate how long the run
of bytes is. For example, if a sequence of five bytes has been found
the run = 5. Of course, using 6 bits limits you to a maximum run length
of 63 bytes but that should be more than enough for most pictures.

Quite a simple method of compaction eh? Definitely the easiest format to
understand!

What this does is load a PCX at the TOP LEFT of the source Bitmap,
very quickly. If you need to put the PCX somewhere else use LocatePCX.


Expects:  FileName to be a standard MS-DOS filename, relating to a
          320 x 200 PCX.
          ThePalette to be of type Palette. This holds the colour
          information of the PCX file you are loading.

You can then use SetAllPalette to set the VGA palette so that
the pic can display properly.

{
Home grown PCX packer.

This PCX routine is able to cope with the full 256 colours,
unlike some other SWAG PCX packers I could mention.. !

Expects:    FileName is the name of the PCX to save.
            ThePalette is a PaletteType variable, which has been
            initialised by, for example, the GetAllPalette routine.
            X,Y specify the horizontal and vertical positions of where to
            begin grabbing the PCX data from.
            PCXWidth and PCXHeight specify the width & height of the
            window to grab. Easy eh?

            For example, to grab one half of the VGA screen you could use:
            SaveAreaAsPCX('1STHALF.PCX',MyPalette,0,0,160,200);

            And the other half with :

            SaveAreaAsPCX('2NDHALF.PCX',MyPalette,160,0,160,200);

            These files can then be loaded into a paint package such
            as PC Paintbrush or Neopaint (great program!) and manipulated.

            Use the SAVEPCX routine below to save an entire PCX screen.


Returns:    Program will halt if the PCX is not found.


P.S. This routine manages to save a 256 colour screen properly,
     unlike some other PCX writing routines I could mention. Do you
     programmers actually TEST your code before sending it into the
     SWAG ? (Like, are there any GIF loaders that work ?!!)

                If the last byte read is equal to the new byte read
                then a run of bytes has been identified and so the
                system needs to count how many identical bytes (up
                to a total of 63) follow. When finished, the
                system writes this count to disk PLUS a value of
                192 (which is the signal to the PCX reader that
                a run of bytes follows) then writes the byte that
                was prevalent in the run.

                For example, say in the data stream there were 10
                values :

                0 1 2 6 9 8 7 7 7 4

                When the system gets to 8 it would then compare
                that number with the next value (7) and see that 8 is
                not equal to 7, then the computer would move to said 7
                (after the 8) and compare it to the next digit, which
                is also a 7.

                As a match has been found, the system counts the
                number of 7s there, which is (all together now !)
                3!! and then adds 192 to the result.. to give 195.

                As stated before, bits 6 + 7 of the byte have
                been set in order to "flag" to the PCX reader that
                a run of bytes have been found.

                The value 195 is written to disk, then value 7 so the
                PCX reader that loads this file knows what value (and
                how many times) to write to the screen during unpacking.

                I hope this has explained one of the PCX mysteries. If
                it hasn't I typed all that for nothing!! :-)
