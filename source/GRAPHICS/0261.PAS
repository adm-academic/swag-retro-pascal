FILENAME :    REMAP.PAS

AUTHOR   :    SCOTT TUNSTALL B.Sc

CREATION :    16TH NOVEMBER 1996
DATE

PURPOSE  :    ORGANISES THE PALETTE OF A 256 COLOUR PCX SO THAT
              THE USED COLOURS ARE ARRANGED SEQUENTIALLY,
              AND UN-USED COLOURS IN YOUR PCX ARE DELETED
              (MEANING, RESET TO R,G,B 0 0 0 )

              THIS UTIL IS ONLY USEFUL FOR GAMES PROGRAMMERS,
              OR THOSE WHO WANT A WELL ORGANISED PALETTE!


       THIS UTIL NEEDS KOJAKVGA 3.3 FOR SUCCESSFUL OPERATION!!
       KOJAKVGA 3.1/3.2 HAS BUGS IN THE PCX SAVE ROUTINES.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


INTRODUCTION
------------

With a 256 colour picture, it's quite likely that not all 256 colours
are used on screen.

This program counts the number of colours used in a PCX file, then
organises the palette entries so that all colours used are
sequential. Duh?

Say for example you had a PCX file which used 6 from the 256 colours.
The colours used being 1,2,4,9,127,255. (The rest obviously
are unused.)

Wouldn't you like those colours to be remapped so that colour 4
would move to unused colour slot 3, colour 9 to 4, colour 127 to 5?
Thus having colours 1,2,3,4,5,6 used? And 7-255 free?

"Why?" You ask. Reason is, games programmers like to reserve a portion
of the palette for sprites and the other portion for the background.

Say colours 0-127 was reserved for shapes, and 128-255 was
reserved for the background. But colour 200 was used as a
shape colour.

That would mean every 128 colour background palette you loaded
would have to preserve colour 200's RGB value just in case a
shape required it.

And say the shape palette needed to be changed but a background
palette needed a particular colour. Annoying huh?

By using this program with a bare background screen (no sprites
present) you can organise your palette and then allocate a sequential
palette space for sprites.

        Do not sue me :)



WHAT DO YOU DO?
---------------

This works from DOS:

Syntax: REMAP [/M] <256 Colour PCX to remap> [Dest PCX name]


If you specify the command line /M (For MERGE) then the palette
shall be shrunk to it's smallest size; duplicate palette entries
shall be merged if two colours present on screen have identical
RGB values. (Of course, this may disrupt PCX's with hidden
graphics, say for example, black text on a black background,
which will then be faded in later on in a program)

You MUST specify the name of the PCX to remap. The PCX may be
UP TO 320 x 200: IF LARGER, THE PCX's DIMENSIONS ARE CLIPPED
TO 320 x 200!!!

You need not specify the name of the destination PCX file. The
default name is REMAPPED.PCX .


When the program ends, you will be told how many colours were used.
This number also indicates the first free colour which you can use
for backgrounds etc.

If you decided to condense the palette, you will see how many
colours remain after palette merge.




DISCLAIMER
----------

If the PCX turns out funny it's not my fault OK! And I take ZERO
responsibility for any damage this program causes. This program
seems to work OK on my machine. (i.e. -> it's not crashed yet)

Use this program at your own risk.

Normally I'd write 20000 lines of documentation for this, but really
I can't be bothered as it's operation is so simple.

Basically the RGB data for colour ColNo in Palette SrcPal
is moved to colour NewNo in Palette DstPal, and every pixel
which matches colour ColNo on the source bitmap is changed to
colour NewNo on the dest bitmap.

Got that? No? Tough! =)
