{
  Gayle, could you please make sure that this is packaged with KOJAKVGA
  3.3, as that is the only unit that uses PCXCache at the moment.
  Thanks.


  FILENAME : PCXCACHE.PAS

  AUTHOR   : SCOTT TUNSTALL B.Sc

  CREATION : 24TH NOVEMBER 1996
  DATE

  PURPOSE  : TO SUPPLEMENT KOJAKVGA'S PCX WRITING ROUTINES WHICH
             SHOULD NOW BE 200% FASTER THAN THE OLDER
             CONTINUOUS DISK ACCESS ROUTINES USED IN NEWGRAPH
             AND OLDER KOJAKVGA VERSIONS.

             THIS UNIT WILL WORK WITH ANY FILE-TYPE HOWEVER.


  TESTING  : TESTED ON P133 W/ 800Mb HARD DISK CAP.
  INFO       (Guess who's started work then? :) )



  DISCLAIMER : USE THIS UNIT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I TAKE NO
               RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR
               PC HARDWARE OR FILES CAUSED BY THESE ROUTINES.

               THEY WORK FINE ON MY PC.
