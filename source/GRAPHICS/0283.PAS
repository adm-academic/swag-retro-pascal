AUTHOR    : SCOTT "Lieutenant Kojak" TUNSTALL

CREATION  : 24TH NOVEMBER 1996
DATE

PURPOSE   : To demonstrate the fast blit functions of KOJAKVGA 3.


NOTES     :

I saw this 16 x 10 pixel "fade-in" first at College and thought
"ooh! Ain't that smart" (well, I'd never seen a SVGA PC before;
I'd come from Amiga-Land, 32 colours etc. etc.)

As a programming exercise I reproduced the effect with my
KOJAKVGA unit. Hope you like it.


What YOU do is:

o Specify the name of the PCX file to fade in (can be up to 320 x
  200 in size) as the command line parameter.

o Gasp with amazement as the PCX fades into your view.
  (That was sarcasm)

o Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to rid yourself of the misery.




DISCLAIMER :

Use this at your own risk. If you really must.
This program works just dandy on my PC.
