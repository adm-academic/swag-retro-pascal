Actually, you can make it a lot faster.
Since I haven't seen the original post, there is no way for me to know what
you need this for, but to speed up execution speed, I've divided it into
two files, raw2mxi, and viewmxi.  If it is intended for a viewer (but
then you wouldn't use mode X at all, I guess), there should be no problems
rewriting it, sorry for the slow disk read/write routines, but I'm a little
rusty in Pascal. (Haven't used it the last half year.)
There is two differences, one I write to the change plane ports 4 times
while van Gaalen wrote to the ports each time he drew a pixel, and when I
draw, I just use int 21 (Yes, I know this might be slower, but on slower
machines, you may actually gain speed on slower systems because the DOS
file handler uses DMA to write directly to the memory area.

  it assumes that the given file is a raw image without a header (i.e. it
  only contains the pixel color information. I leave it up to the coder to
  add the pallette since he wanted it to be a raw image (for the uninitated,
  a raw image is basically a string of bytes. There is nothing that indicates
  the pallette, the size of the image or anything.

  And yes, I know I could probably optimize this code a lot, but I'm lazy :)
  and this doesn't affect run-time of the other part of the program.

That's all I guess.

Just to be on the safe side:
I'm allowing anyone to use this code without any restrictions or legalities,
except that the one who compiles this code takes responsibility for what
happens with the machine, this code will work if the machine is set up
correctly, but I don't know how it'll work on a machine without a vga
compatible device connected since the code write to some of its prots.
