  As  promised,  here  is  some  TP-code  to  check whether your machine
  supports  the  extended timing services of the AT's-BIOS: if all works
  fine,  the  Program should give two beeps, the 2nd exactly 5secs after
  the 1st one -and then terminate.

  (To  all  others  reading  this:  this  timing  scheme  normally works
  _asynchrone_ to whatever you are doing in the "foreground" Program and
  thus  is  great  For  timing  events.  What's  more:  the  clock has a
  resolution of some microseconds!)
