you can find them by reading the 7 (seven) WORDs starting at address 0040:0000
<smile>...

CONST
  BIOSBASE : word = $0040;
  PORTADDR : word = $0000;

VAR
  COM1, COM2,
  COM3, COM4,
  LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 : word;

BEGIN
  COM1 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+0];
  COM2 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+2];
  COM3 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+4];
  COM4 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+6];
  LPT1 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+8];
  LPT2 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+10];
  LPT3 := memw[BIOSBASE:PORTADDR+12];
END.

Do this, it works.  When you WRITELN the variables to the
screen, they will be in decimal.  If you convert them to hex,
you'll see that they are the old, familiar addresses.  If any
variable is zero, there is no port present in your computer.

Another thing you'll notice, if you have com4, for instance, but
no com3.  The normal com4 address will show up in the com3
memory location, and the com4 adderess will be 0.  Which
explains why funny things happen when you are using ports 1, 2
and 4 with no 3, or 1 and 3 with no 2, etc., and why we are told
to always have consecutive com ports, with no "missing" numbers.
