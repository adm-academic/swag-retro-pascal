 well here is somthing i used to get a scale for the Delay command i have
 in my drop in replacement CRT Unit, this will get a scale of the machine
 runing so that if the program gets run on different speed machines the
 code will analize it to produce the scale so DELAY will properly work on
 different machines.

 the speed is a Word Variable i use in the normal area of pascal

 my 486 sx priduces aprox 39,450 at 33Mhz, when 8 mhz is runing it will
 produce aprox 10,500..
  So with that i think you can figure out somthing..
