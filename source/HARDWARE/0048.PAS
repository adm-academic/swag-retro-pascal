 DB $F,$A2
 EAX must be set to 0 or 1 to request 2 modes of CPUID. Try looking in

Interrupt List for more info...

A lot of software recognizes Pentium only by this bit...

 By timing memory transfers. 386sx and 486slc have 16 bit access while 386dx
and 486dlc do 32 bits at a time. Below is my procedure, mostly BASM :-( It may
get wrong if there are interrupts occuring while test.
}

function dx386 : boolean;
{
 Checks whether CPU is 386SX or DX. This is done by timing memory transfers:
 - on SX, there is very small difference between 32 bit moves and double
   16 bit moves, because SX does them 16 bit at a time anyway
 - on DX, dbl 16 bit moves are slower than 32 bit ones, because it does them
   at 32 bits anyway, so half of them is misaligned (requiring two movs).
 On SX, mov32/2*mov16 gives about 1.0-1.1 (with loop/timer int overhead)
 On DX, mov32/2*mov16 gives about 1.5     (ditto)
