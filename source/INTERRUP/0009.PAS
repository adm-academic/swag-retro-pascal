    Your handler is changing some registers or suffering from some
registers being changed by INT 21. DOS EXEC service trashes everything,
including SS:SP, for example. In my opinion, one can't write a stable
INT 21 handler in Pascal or any other HLL. HLL interrupt handlers are
usable to certain extent, but this is too low level.

    It can be done in BASM, though. We will declare interrupt handler as
simple procedure with no arguments to avoid entry/exit code TP generates
for interrupt handlers. Our handler will force all files to be opened in
Deny Write mode (modify for your needs).


const
  shCompatibility = $00;
  shDenyAll       = $10;
  shDenyWrite     = $20;
  shDenyRead      = $30;
  shDenyNone      = $40;

procedure NewInt21; assembler;
asm
  cmp   ah, 3Dh         {open file?}
  je    @CheckModeAL
  cmp   ah, 6Ch         {DOS 4.0+ extended open?}
  je    @CheckModeBL    {extended takes mode in BX}
  jmp   @Chain

@CheckModeAL:
  and   al, 10001111b     {clear sharing mode bits}
  or    al, shDenyWrite   {set to our mode}
  jmp   @Chain

@CheckModeBL:
  and   bl, 10001111b
  or    bl, shDenyWrite
  jmp   @Chain

@I21:
  DD      0       {temp. var. for old vector -- must be in code seg.}

@Chain:
  push  ds
  push  ax
  mov   ax, SEG @Data
  mov   ds, ax
  mov   ax, WORD PTR OldInt21
  mov   WORD PTR cs:[offset @I21], ax
  mov   ax, WORD PTR OldInt21 +2
  mov   WORD PTR cs:[offset @I21 +2], ax
  pop   ax
  pop   ds
  jmp   DWORD PTR cs:[offset @I21]
end;


    To try this save old vector in a global variable named OldInt21 and
install this handler as usual. It also traps function 6Ch, DOS 4.0+
extended open/create. Very few programs use it, but why not...
