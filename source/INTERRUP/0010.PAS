This will not work correctly.  Using interrupt 1Ch as it is normally set up,
your interrupt routine will only be called 18 times a second (18.2, actually),
so you could get a maximum of 18.2 Hz.  If you wait until a counter in this
interrupt (incremented by 1 each time) reaches 1820, it will take 10 seconds!
It WON'T be 100 Hz.

In order to hook the timer interrupt at a rate above 18.2 Hz, you'll need to
revector int 08h (which calls int 1Ch anyway).  You'll have to set up a counter
in int 08h which makes sure that the ORIGINAL int 08h routine is still called
18.2 times a second.  The value for this counter will vary, depending on how
fast you set timer channel 0.  The system clock has a maximum resolution of
about 1.19318 Mhz and IRQ0 is normally called 1193180/65536 times per second.

Here's some code for changing the clock rate (sorry but it's ASM):

ClkRate PROC NEAR

  push  ax
  mov   al,36h
  out   43h,al
  pop   ax
  out   40h,al  xchg  ah,al
  out   40h,al
  ret
ClkRate ENDP

;******************
; call this routine from TP as SetClockRate (Hz : WORD);
SetClockRate PROC FAR

Rate EQU word ptr [bp+06]
  push  bp
  mov   bp,sp
  cmp   rate,0
  je    SCR01

  mov   ax,65535
  xor   dx,dx
  mov   bx,rate
  div   bx
  jmp   SCR02

SCR01:
  xor   ax,ax

SCR02:
  call  ClkRate

  mov   sp,bp
  pop   bp
  ret   2

SetClockRate ENDP

I pulled these procedures from some OLD code which I may have inadvertenly
screwed up over time, but it looks o.k.
  Actually revectoring int 08h is a bit more complex - you MUST make sure the
old it 08 is called appropriately because it controls a number of system
functions and your PC WILL lock up if it's not called.  I recommend finding a
book to help with that part.
