BTW: Simple concept...  Here's how it works - When the program begins,
SavedInt23 is assigned to the original C-Break interrupt...  When the
SetCtrlBreak procedure is called with Status equaling false, the C-Break
interrupt is assigned to a CBreakHandler which has no substance...  Thus
when C-Break is called it does nothing.  When SetCtrlBreak is called
with Status equaling false, Interrupt 23h is assigned to the default
C-Break handler.
