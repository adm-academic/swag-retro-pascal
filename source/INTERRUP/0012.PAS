º I understand basically what you're saying - have a TSR/ISR define
º Variables Within itself, then have any child processes hook into those
º Variables via an interupt inquiry. However, I'm still a bit fuzzy on it.
º Could you provide an example, or a better definition?

    Here's an example of how to hook an interrupt....
}

Unit ExampleInt;  { Interrupt hooker example }

{ Written 08/15/93 by Chris Lautenbach.  Released to the public domain.     }

{ This Unit, when placed in the Uses clause of your main Program, will hook }
{ Dos Interrupt 28h (Dos Idle) which is called by Dos when it isn't busy.   }
{ Under normal circumstances, this will produce a sort of 'multitasking'    }
{ effect when Dos calls it.  Make sure you call the NotBusy Procedure in    }
{ any keyboard wait loops -- or any other loop that continues For a While,  }
{ otherwise Dos will not get a chance to service Int 28h.                   }

{ In addition to hooking Int28h, it also provides a custom Exit Procedure   }
{ to deactivate the interrupt.  In this manner, this Unit can be totally    }
{ transparent to the Program it is included in -- even if the Program       }
{ terminates With an error, the interrupt is always disconnected.           }

{ Access to IntStart and IntStop are provided thru the Interface section to }
{ allow disabling of the interrupt -- in Case a Dos shell or similar        }
{ operation is required.                                                    }
