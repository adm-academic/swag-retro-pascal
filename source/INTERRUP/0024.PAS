First define some constants:

CONST Bit0 =   1;
      Bit1 =   2;
      Bit2 =   4;
      Bit3 =   8;
      Bit4 =  16;
      Bit5 =  32;
      Bit6 =  64;
      Bit7 = 128;

Now, if you want to see if, say, bit number two is set,  you do it like 
this:

in Pascal: IF YourVariable AND Bit2 <> 0 THEN { -- it's set }

in BASM  : ; assume the quantity of interest is in AH
           test ah, Bit2
           je @@Yes
           ; -- at this point, the bit is not set
           @@Yes:
           ; -- and here, it is
