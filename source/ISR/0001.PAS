{ The above 2 lines of code give the hour & minute.. How?? The first
  memory location gives the hour thats easy, but the minutes are a
  little more tricky... The interrupt i'm gonna hook into is int 8
  ... it is called approximately 18.2 times/second. When its called,
  it increments 0000:046c hex. When it overflows, it inc's 0000:046e
  (which is the hour in 24 hr Format) so, dividing by 18 would give
  us the approximate second in the hour, div'ding by 60 then gives
  the hour                                                              }
