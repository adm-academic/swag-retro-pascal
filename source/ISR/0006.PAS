Unit MyCheck;
{
  Version: 2.0 (8 jan 1993).

             TeeCee     Bob Swart  Saved:
  Code size: 514 Bytes  472 Bytes  42 Bytes
  Data size:  32 Bytes   32 Bytes   0 Bytes

  Here is the $1C ISR that I will add (unless you wish to do that).

  Some changes were made, which resulted in less code and data size, a
  little more speed, and display of the progress Variable on screen is
  made 'ticking' each second by changing the colour from white on blue
  to gray on blue and back With each update.
  Also, the Variable Test8086 is set to 0 when the ISR in entered, and
  reset to the value Save8086 (initialized at startup) on Exit. Hereby
  we elimiate potential BTP7 problems With using LongInts in ISRs, and
  not saving Extended Registers properly.
