Well, to have them run at the exact same time isn't possible. You can swap
back and forth pretty quick though. The basic idea is that when the
computer is idle (waiting For a key, displaying a Text File, etc) you have
it jump to your routine.

  Write(H, ':', M, ':', S, '.', MS);
  TextAttr := CurA;
  GotoXy(CurX, CurY);
