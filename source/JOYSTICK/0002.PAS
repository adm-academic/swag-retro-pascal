Anyone know how to read the Joystick.... I only need Joy(1) read....
I have used 1 Procedure i d/led, but all it did was tell me if the buttons
were down (it didnt work in telling me which direction (it should of))

IBM-PC GAME CONTROL ADAPTER. THE TWO Function CALLS ARE EACH
CompLETE in ITSELF. EITHER ONE or BOTH CAN BE MOVED to ANY
Program THAT NEEDS THE USE of JOYSTICKS or PADDLES.

   toWARD ZERO. WHEN CX REACHES ZERO or WHEN THE ONE-SHOT ON THE GAME
   ADAPTER TIMES OUT, THE LOOPinG StoPS and "COUNTER" IS ASSIGNED THE NUMBER
   of COUNTS THAT toOK PLACE. MAXCOUNT SHOULD BE CHOSEN SO THAT CX NEVER
   REACHES 0 SO THAT THE USABLE RANGE of THE JOYSTICK WILL not BE LIMITED.
