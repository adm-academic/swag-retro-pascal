{
The basic approach to reading a joystick is to monitor port 201h.  The eight
bits at that port correspond to:

01h - Joystick A, "X" position
02h - Joystick A, "Y" position
04h - Joystick B, "X" position
08h - Joystick B, "Y" position
10h - Joystick A, button 1
20h - Joystick A, button 2
40h - Joystick B, button 1
80h - Joystick B, button 2

The buttons are easy: a bit of "0" means "pressed" and "1" means "not
pressed".  But a single bit to read a joystick position?!?  Here's what
you do:

1)  Write a value -- any value -- to port 201h.  The four lowest bits
    will then all assume a value of "1".

2)  Start a counter, and see how many iterations it takes for your
    desired bit to go to zero.  The number of iterations = the joystick
    position, with lower values corresponding to "left" or "up" and
    higher values corresponding to "right" or "down".

Like any joystick code, thess routines return the button statuses and the
joystick positions.  They also return boolean indicators of whether the
stick is left or right, up or down, based on a sensitivity you define.

The routines you call are:

procedure calibrate(r: real) -- Call this at the beginning of your program.
                                Determines presence of joysticks and how
                                far the stick has to be moved to constitute
                                L/R/U/D.  "r" is a real value from 0 to 1;
                                a value of 0.25 means that the stick has to
                                move 25% from center to count as L/R/U/D.
procedure readsticks         -- Reads sticks and buttons.  Call this once
                                every round of play or whatever.
