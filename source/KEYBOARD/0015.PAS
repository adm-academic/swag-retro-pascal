{AM±Hi everyone, I have a question. I need to know if there is some simple
AM±way to do the following. I want to pass as a parameter to a Procedure
AM±that will indicate what keypresses are valid. I am doing this already
AM±for regular keys, but I need to be able to list regular keys as well as
AM±extended key(mostly Function keys).

AM±I do like so,

AM±Command_Keys : Set of Char ['Q', 'A', 'K'];
AM±Is there a way to add extended keys to the above.

Declare extended scan codes, then format them into an Array:
