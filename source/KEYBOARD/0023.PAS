I have seen a number of messages recently about keyboard access.  Here are
some neat FAST routines to use instead of ReadKey (Crt Unit).  Be advised
that in these routines, I add 128 to the HI Byte in order to be able to use
all 256 Characters.  Just remember to add 128 to test For all Function keys.
