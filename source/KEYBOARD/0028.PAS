An easy one: You forgot to tell the compiler how much memory your program
wants. Put the following directive at the beginning of your program:

{$M 1024,0,0}
PROGRAM NoPrintScreen;
[...]

That little "{$M" tells the compiler to tell DOS that you don't want a lot of
RAM when loaded. Otherwise, your application will allocate (and Keep) all
available RAM in the system (effectively making your program a 640K TSR!).

Ah, that would be a bit trickier.... You'd need to trap Int 9 using some
assembly code (but my brain is mush right now, so I'll let someone else help
you on that).
