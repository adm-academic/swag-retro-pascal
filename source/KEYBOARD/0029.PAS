You made your own 'Crt'? I'd like some help!
The only thing I haven't been able to do so far is the stupid KeyPressed...
I have successfully made a really good ReadKey (return a String [2], so I can
even read arrows, Functions keys (even F11 and F12))

Here's my ReadKey (I case anybody would like to have it),
but I you could help me with the KeyPressed...
(Byt the way, does your 'direct video' is made like this?
 Type
    VideoChar = Record
                   Ascii : Char;
                   Color : Byte;
                end;
    Var
       VideoRam : Array [1..25,1..80] of VideoChar Absolute $B800:0000; )

Here's my 'ReadKey':

Function Inkey : String;
   Var
      K : Word;
      T : String [2];
   Begin
      Asm
         mov  ah, 10h
         int  16h
         mov  K, ax
      end;
      T := '';
      If ((K and 255) = 0) or ((K and 255) = 224) then
         T := ' '+ Chr (Trunc ((K and 65280) / 256))
      else
         T := Chr (K and 255);
      Inkey := T;
   End;

So what about a 'KeyPressed' ?

Thanks 'n bye
