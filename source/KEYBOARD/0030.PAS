Unit TPbuffer;

(* TP-Buffer unit version 1.1 /Update              *)
(* Using the keyboard's buffer in Turbo Pascal     *)
(* This unit is released to the public domain      *)
(* by Lavi Tidhar on 5-10-1992                     *)

(* This unit adds three special functions not      *)
(* incuded in the Turbo Pascal regular package     *)

(* You may alter this source code, move the        *)
(* procedures to your own programs. Please do      *)
(* NOT change these lines of documentation         *)

(* This source might teach you about how to        *)
(* use interrupts in pascal, and the keyboard's    *)
(* buffer. from the other hand, it might not :-)   *)

(* Used: INT 16, functions 0 and 1                 *)
(*       INT 21, function 0Ch                      *)

(* INT 16 - KEYBOARD - READ CHAR FROM BUFFER, WAIT IF EMPTY
           AH = 00h
           Return: AH = scan code
                   AL = character         *)

(* INT 16 - KEYBOARD - CHECK BUFFER, DO NOT CLEAR
           AH = 01h
           Return: ZF = 0 character in buffer
                       AH = scan code
                       AL = character
                       ZF = 1 no character in buffer *)

(* INT 21 - DOS - CLEAR KEYBOARD BUFFER
        AH = 0Ch
        AL must be 1, 6, 7, 8, or 0Ah.
        Notes: Flushes all typeahead input, then executes function specified by AL
        (effectively moving it to AH and repeating the INT 21 call).
        If AL contains a value not in the list above, the keyboard buffer is
        flushed and no other action is taken. *)
