FUNCTION Read_Key : word;
{ DESCRIPTION:
    Reads a key from the keyboard buffer, WITHOUT removing it.
  SAMPLE CALL:
    NW := Read_Key;
  RETURNS:
    The scan code of the key that is ready to be readen from the buffer, or,
      if there is no key in the buffer, returns $FFFF value.
  NOTES:
    This is a special function. It's only to be called in very special
      situations. It checks if a key is ready in the keyboard
      buffer. If there is a key, then the key is readed but NOT removed
      from the buffer. The key will remain in the buffer. }

    Read_Key := HTregs.AX
  else
    Read_Key := $FFFF;
