It returns the Character part of the Char/scan code combo in the current
head of the keyboard buffer queue in the bios data area.
The scan code would be at the location $40:head+1.

It would probably be more efficient if you used $0:$41A instead of
$40:$1A, but that might cause problems With protected mode.

Var
  head : Word Absolute $40 : $1A;
  tail : Word Absolute $40 : $1C;

Function peekKey : Char;
begin
  if head = tail then
    peekKey := #0
  else
    peekKey := Char(mem[$40 : head]);
end;
