> How do I stuff a string into the keyboard buffer?

I've got two things for you:

1:  Turbo Power's Object Professional's OpCRT unit has the following
useful routines:
procedure StuffKey(W : Word);
  {-Stuff one key into the keyboard buffer}

procedure StuffString(S : string);
  {-Stuff the contents of S into the keyboard buffer}

{
2: If you don't have Object Professional (it's $895.00 but worth it)
Before I noticed that OpCRT would do what I needed, I sat down and
wrote the following code.  It's rough, but gives a pretty good idea
of how the keyboard buffer works, and there's a chance that you can
use it to create your own Stuffer
