This should work:
}

function enhanced_keyboard:boolean; assembler;

asm
   mov ah,09h
   int 16h        {Call Interrupt $16, Function $09}
   shr al,1
   shr al,1
   shr al,1
   shr al,1
   shr al,1       {Shifts the bits in al right 5 times}
   and al,1       {We want to only test the first bit in al}
end;

{
This will return true if the enchanced keyboard functions are supported.  If
you are compiling with the $G+ directive, then change the five 'shr al,1' to
one 'shr al,5'.   Hope this helps.
}
