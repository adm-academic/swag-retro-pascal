{ from SWAG, STUFF KYBD BUF by Rob Perelman, at beginning of KEYBOARD.SWG
  section.  Modified by Bill Brachhold ( willie@hal.eng.ufl.edu ) to make
  into a pseudo-Exec command.  It is sorta like Exec but is NOT a
  shell-type like Exec. It basically stuffs the keyboard buffer with
  the name of the program you want to run, then exits to DOS where DOS
  'finds' the program name and executes it.  Its big advantage is that it
  consumes NO memory when the other program starts.  Obviously, to get back
  to the first program, you would have to 'ExecProg' to it also.
