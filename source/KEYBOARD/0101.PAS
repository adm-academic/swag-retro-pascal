Hi Everyone,

I was having some trouble getting an interrupt $09 routine to work and
Lou Douchez put some code on here that helped me out.  I am now posting
the code so that anyone who needs it can use it.  Thanks Lou!

Sorry about the squeeze I wanted to make it all fit in one message.

You simply add this unit to your uses clause.  Everything is loaded and
unloaded automatically. All you need do is if you want to check to see
if the RightKey is pressed (right arrow) then you do this.
if keys[rightkey] then do_something;
BTW I only have 79 of the keycodes defined. I don't use the others so I
don't really know what they are.
