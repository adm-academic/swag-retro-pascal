To flush the keyboard, you can do it like this: }

procedure flushkb; assembler;
asm
  mov ax,0c00h
  int 21h
end;

or simply use a "mem[$0000:$041c]:=mem[$0000:$041a];" command.  To toggle the
status of the number lock, caps lock, and scroll lock keys, the following
procedures can be used.

procedure capslock(on:boolean);
begin
  if on then mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] or $40
    else
  mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] and $bf;
end;

procedure numlock(on:boolean);
begin
  if on then mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] or $20
    else
  mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] and $df;
end;

procedure scrolllock(on:boolean);
begin
  if on then mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] or $10
    else
  mem[$40:$17]:=mem[$40:$17] and $ef;
end;

... If you need routines to detect whether the caps/scroll/number lock keys
are on or off, these may be of use ...

function capslockon:boolean;
begin
  capslockon:=mem[$0040:$0017] and $40=$40;
end;

function numlockon:boolean;
begin
  numlockon:=mem[$0040:$0017] and $20=$20;
end;

function scrollockon:boolean;
begin
  scrollockon:=mem[$0040:$0017] and $10=$10;
end;

Try this on for size... instead of returning a character, it'll return a
word.  The high portion of the word contains the scan code (the one you
get after doing a second readkey if the first returned #0) and the lower
portion of the word contains the ascii code.

  w:=getkey;

    60:write('F2');
    61:write('F3');
    62:write('F4');
    63:write('F5'); { etc ... }
  end else case chr(lo(w)) of
    '1':write('Pressed 1');

    '3':write('Pressed 3');
    'A':write('Pressed A');
    'B':write('Pressed B');
    'C':write('Pressed C');
  end;
