Someone once posted a message with the header formats for Fido-style *.MSGs. I
took that original message and added to it to get the following program. This
program reads *.MSG files sequentially in your *.MSG directory. You can alter
the program to do whatever you want.

Also all paragraphs are supposed to end with a Hard CR (#141) and you can
ignore any #13 and reformat the text for your own program, also any lines
starting with ^A (#1) should not be imported into the BBS, they are control
lines... the contents of these lines varies so you'll have to find out that on
your own }
