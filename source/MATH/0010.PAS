This Program should work fine.  I tested it a few times and it seemed to work.
It lets you call the Functions For permutation and combination just as you
would Write them: P(n,r) and C(n,r).

Program CombPerm;

Var
  Result:Extended;
Function Factorial(Num: Integer): Extended;
Var
  Counter: Integer;
  Total: Extended;
begin
  Total:=1;
  For Counter:=2 to Num do
    Total:=Total * Counter;
  Factorial:=Total;
end;

Function P(N: Integer;  R: Integer): Extended;
begin
  P:=Factorial(N)/Factorial(N-R);
end;

Function C(N: Integer;  R: Integer): Extended;
begin
  C:=Factorial(N)/(Factorial(N-R)*Factorial(R));
end;

begin
  Writeln(P(52,5));
end.
