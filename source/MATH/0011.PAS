{
I'm working on some statistical process control Charts and am
learning/using Pascal. The current Chart Uses permutations and
I have been successful in determing the number of combinations
possible, but I want to be able to choose a few of those possible
combinations at random For testing purposes.

Through some trial and error, I've written the following Program
which calculates the number of possible combinations of x digits
with a certain number of digits in each combination. For example
a set of 12 numbers With 6 digits in each combination gives an
answer of 924 possible combinations. After all that, here is the
question: Is there a Formula which would calculate what those 924
combinations are? (ie: 1,2,3,4,5,6 then 1,2,3,4,5,7 then 1,2,3,4,5,8
... 1,2,3,4,5,12 and so on? Any help would be appreciated and any
criticism will be accepted.
