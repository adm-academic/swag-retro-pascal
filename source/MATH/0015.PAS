Program CalcPI(input, output);

{ Not the most efficient Program I've ever written.  Mostly it's quick and
  dirty.  The infinite series is very effective converging very quickly.
  It's much better than Pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 ... which converges
  like molasses. }

{  Pi / 4 = 4 * (1/5 - 1/(3*5^3) + 1/(5*5^5) - 1/(7*5^7) + ...) -
                (1/239 - 1/(3*239^3) + 1/(5*239^5) - 1/(7*239^7) + ...) }
