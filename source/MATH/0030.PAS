the following routine uses a brute force approach with some
optimization; it took less than 3 minutes with a 286/12 to find
and print all primes up to 32768, about 50 seconds w/o printing
them; it becomes a bit slow when you get into a 6 digit range

PROGRAM Primes;
VAR
  number,
  max_div,
  divisor : INTEGER;
  prime   : BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  writeln('Primes:');
  writeln('2');
  FOR number := 2 TO MAXINT DO
  BEGIN
    max_div := Round(sqrt(number) + 0.5);
    prime   := number MOD 2 <> 0;
    divisor := 3;
    WHILE prime AND (divisor < max_div) DO
    BEGIN
      prime   := number MOD divisor <> 0;
      divisor := divisor + 2;
    END;
    IF prime THEN
      writeln(number);
