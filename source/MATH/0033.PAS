Hey everybody!  This unit performs calculus operations via basic numerical
methods : integrals, derivatives, and extrema.  By Lou DuChez.  I don't
want any money for this; please just leave my name in the source code
somewhere, since this is the closest I'll ever get to being famous.

All functions return real values.  The last parameter in each function is
a pointer to a "real" function that takes a single "real" parameter:
for example, y(x).  See prior message to Timothy C. Novak for sample prog }

function extremum(x, dx, tolerance : real; f : pointer) : real;
{ This function uses DuChez's Method for finding extrema of a function (yes,
  I seem to have invented it): taking three points, finding the parabola
  that connects them, and hoping that an extremum of the function is near
  the vertex of the parabola.  If not, at least you have a new "x" to try...

  X is the initial value to go extremum-hunting at; dx is how far on either
  side of x to look.  "Tolerance" is a parameter: if two consecutive
  iterations provide x-values within "tolerance" of each other, the answer
  is the average of the two. }

I've put together a unit that does calculus.  This unit could be used, for
example, to approximate the area under a curve (like a circle).

Because of the funny way my offline reader breaks up messages, I'm going
to send you a "test" program first -- which just happens to calculate
the area under a quarter circle -- then the following message (I hope)
will be the unit source code.

{ Get slope of function at 0 by evaluating points 0.01 away from each other. }
{ Find extremum of function, starting at 0.4, initially looking at points

  within 0.001 of each other. }
