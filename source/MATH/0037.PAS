Not too hard. I've done that With some fractal Programs, which were
written For TP5 (it might be easier using OOP With the later versions).

I use two Variables For a complex number of a+bi, usually expressed as
xa and xb (or x.a and x.b as a Record).

For addition/subtraction (complex z=x+y):

 z.a:=x.a+y.a;
 z.b:=x.b+y.b;

For multiplication:

 z.a:=(x.a*y.a)-(x.b*y.b);
 z.b:=(x.a*y.b)+(x.b*y.a);
