To prevent Type errors on input always use Strings and convert them
afterwards using the VAL Procedure.

Try this to trap arithmetic errors.

Unit op8087;

{ The routines below duplicate two Op8087 routines For use in TPW, +
  Exceptions8087 and Error8087.  These routines are helpful when +
  doing Real math and you don't want to explicitly check For divide +
  by zero, underflow, and overflow.  Need to use the compiler +
  directives N+ and G+.  See OPro or 8087 documentation For a complete +
  description of the 8087 status Word returned by Error8087.

  Do not embed Error8087 in a Write statement as the 8087 status Word +
  will be cleared, and the result meaningless.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Added infinity and NAN 'Constants' and created Unit December 1992
  Kevin Whitefoot, Aasgaten 45, N-3060 Svelvik, Norway.

  After this Unit has initialized 8087 exceptions will be OFF and the NAN
  and INF Variables set to NAN and INF respectively.  These Variables can be
  used in comparisons or to indicate uninitialized Variables.  The Variables
  are of Type extended but are compatible With singles and doubles too.  You
  cannot assign the value in INF or NAN to a Real because the Real cannot
  represent these values (if you do you will get error 105).
