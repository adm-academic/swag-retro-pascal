if you Really need to do fast FP-calculations you should use a coprocessor
(or a 486DX) together With its dataTypes SINGLE, DOUBLE and EXTendED.

if you already got a copro and still use Real, that's the worst thing you
can do. In fact using Real With copro is often slower than Without because
the 6 Byte Real always has to be converted into a copro dataType.

Now here is what you can Write instead of x:=sqrt(a);
}
Asm
  fld  a
  fsqrt
  fstp x
end;
