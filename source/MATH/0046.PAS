Here is a Program that I have written to derive Pi.  The formula is
4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9... ad infinitum.  Unfortunately, I can only get
14 decimal places using TP 6.  if there is a way For me to be able to get
more than 14 decimal places, please let me know.

NB: Program Modified by Kerry Sokalsky to increase speed by over 40% -
    I'm sure tons more can be done to speed this up even more.

        I have to warn you, it took me two hours to get a definite answer
for 6 decimal places on my 486sx25.  I guess it would be faster on a dx.
I'll run it on a 486dx2/66 on Tuesday and see if I can get it out to 14
decimal places.  It takes about 135000 iterations to get 4 decimal places.
Again, please let me know if you know of a way to get more than 14 decimal
places -- I would love to get this sucker out to more. :)
