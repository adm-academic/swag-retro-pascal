Just (in this implementation) a longint, with the high 16 bits representing the
integer part, and the low 16 representing the binary fraction (to 16 binary
places). Basically a 32-bit binary number with the binary point fixed at the
16th position.

Adding and subtracting such numbers is just like working with straight
longints. No problem. But when multiplying and dividing the number must be
shifted so the binary point's still in the right place.

These are inline procedures, for speed, and only work on 386 or better,
to save me headaches while coding this sucker.

  outputFixed(a.l + fixedDiv(a.l, $20000));
  b.l := fixedMul(a.l, $48000);
  outputFixed(b.l);
  outputFixed(fixedDiv(b.l, $60000 + a.l));
  outputFixed(scaleFixed($30000, $48000, $60000));
end.

I'll let you figure out outputFixed for yourself.
