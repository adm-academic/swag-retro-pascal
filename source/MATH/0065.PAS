  { A negative area as an answer, is the result of incorrectly defining
  the lower and upper bounds for a function.  For example, using the
  function

    6 - 6x^5, a perfectly justifiable lower bound would be 0, while - 5
    would not be.  a perfectly justifiable upper bound would be 1, while
    6 would not be.  The non-justifiable bounds used as examples, are not
    defined in the function used, so a negative area would result in this
    case

  { rectangles dictated by the 'number of divisions'.  The more you    }
  { divide up this area, the more accurate an approximation becomes.   }
