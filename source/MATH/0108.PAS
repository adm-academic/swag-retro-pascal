Well, considering we are looking at numbers under 32 bits, your code
would probably not get done as fast as mine, though in the long run,
(say over 64 bits or so) it would.  All the FFT's and rather long
multiplication would slow it down considerably.  Even if you could get
a really fast implementation of FFT's and multiplications, we're
talking about a net savings of about .625 seconds or so with numbers
under 32 bits on a computer with a Math Processor... so mine's good
enough... although a few of multiplications could be taken out...
