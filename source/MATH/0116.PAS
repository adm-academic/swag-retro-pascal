    This unit has been typed from the top of my head, so test
    it first with the examples in my previous message to Eli.
    As a matter of fact, this is a Unit that is based upon
    my explanations to Eli, so it somewhat NEEDS it ;)

    But I tested it though, just before posting it ;)

    This unit may be published in the next SWAGs (at least I
    think something like this belongs at least in the MISC SWAG
    becos it doesn't have one yet (I think).)
    but include the other mail too! (the previous one)

        You may use this in any production you want
        just notice me of the result, always happy to
        see such stuff ;) ... not needed to credit me,
        just greet me (either in the documentation or
        in the demo/game/softpackage ;)
