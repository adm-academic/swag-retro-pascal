
Below is a function I'm using in a program I'm writing.  What it will do is
take a given string in the form 1-1/2 and convert it from a mixed number
into a floating point number. (e.g. 1-1/2 to 1.5)  I was wondering if there
was a better way to implement it than the way I have below.  (It's ugly, but
it works.)  The program is being written in Delphi 1.02 (but Pascal is
Pascal, no matter how one looks at it.  :-)

I'd much rather force people to just input a friggin' decimal,
unfortunately, the databases are old and have already been saved.  Anyway,
code snippet to follow.

 Begin
  function FracToFloat(Incoming : string): Single;
    var i : integer;
    begin
      Incoming := Trim(Incoming);
      i := Pos('-',Incoming);
      if i = 0 then begin
        try Result := StrToFloat(Incoming);
        except
          on EConvertError do Result := 0.0;
        end;
        exit;
      end;
      Result := StrToFloat(Copy(Incoming,1,i-1));
      Incoming := Copy(Incoming,i+1,Length(Incoming)-i);
      i := Pos('/',Incoming);
      Result := Result + StrToInt(Copy(Incoming,1,i-1))/
		StrToInt(Copy(Incoming,i+1,Length(Incoming)-i));
    end;
End

BTW, the Trim function (in the first line of the proc body) is my own
creation for Delphi.  It yanks out ALL spaces, not just leading/trailing.

Program FractionalStrings;
{ written in Turbo v.6.0  <clifpenn@airmail.net>  Nov 3, 1996
  Accepts string input of the form 5-3/4 and converts to a floating
  point number. However, '  ab  cd.xx5nmjk---3   xxx///cc  4  ***'
will be cleaned up to show 5-3/4 = 5.75000, also. Will not convert
negative numbers as written but is trivial to change. }
