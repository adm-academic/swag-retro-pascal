   Please feel free to use this unit on your program,
   give me Credit if you like.... Enjoy!

 This is quite fast, and is about 50-80% faster than the fastest one in SWAG.
 As this Function is optimized for large numbers, you may not see any
 differents is small numbers, but it only takes about 6 seconds to find all
 the primes from 1000000 to 1020000. A newer version will be out soon
 which should be about 10-20% faster.

P.S. If you've found some ways to optimized this unit, please feel free to
change anything, it's nice if you can send me a copy.

Unit Prime;

Interface
Function PrimeChk(Num: LongInt): Boolean;

Implementation

Function PrimeChk(Num: LongInt): Boolean;
Var x : Longint;
    y : Integer;
Begin
 x := -1; y := 0;
 Case Num Of
  2,3 : Begin PrimeChk := True; Exit; End;
  1 : Begin PrimeChk := False; Exit; End;
 End;
If (Num mod 2)=0 Then Begin PrimeChk := False; Exit; End; {Check if Even #}

While (Sqr(x) < Num) And (y < 2) Do
Begin
   x := x + 2; { Only check with Odd numbers }
   If (Num mod x)=0 Then y:=y+1;
End;
 If y <> 1 Then PrimeChk := False Else PrimeChk := True;
End;

End.

Program Example;
Uses Prime;
Var Number : LongInt;
Begin
{List all Primes from 1000000 to 1020000}
For Number := 1000000 to 1020000 Do
If PrimeChk(Number) = True Then Write(Number,' ');
End.
