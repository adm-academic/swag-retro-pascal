all of your prime
  number programs. Although I don't know all about Turbo Pascal I do know
how to
  make a faster Prime tester for Numbers < 31-bit, If you like it, copy it,
use routines
  or whatever, but please think about leaving me credits

  This program builds on the (theory) that a prime is always equal to
(X*6+1) or
  (X*6-1) this I read of in a magazine. And it seems to work... I have with
this been
  able to take lead (I think) with 50% faster routine than the others
