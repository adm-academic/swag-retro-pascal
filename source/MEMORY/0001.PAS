Response;
1. Declare the Variable Value as LOData -
        e.g. Var Value : LOData;

2. Read MaxSizeArray;

3. Allocate memory For the Array by using NEW() or GETMEM()
         e.g. NEW(Value);
        or   GetMem(Value, Sizeof(Real) * MaxSizeArray);

Getmem() is better because you can allocate just the precise amount of
memory needed.

4. From then on refer to your Array as Value
        e.g. Value[Element] := NewValue;

5. When you finish, deallocate memory by
        [a] Dispose(Value) - if you used NEW() to begin with, or
        [b] FreeMem(Value, Sizeof(Real) * MaxSizeArray) - if you used
        GetMem() to begin with.
