The following code was *mostly* right. Go back to your original source to
compare the changes I made:

 procedure check_ems (VAR installed:boolean; VAR ver,ver2:byte); var
   regs  :  registers;
 begin
   regs.ax := $46;
   intr($67,regs);
   installed := regs.ah = $00;
   if (installed = true) then
     begin
       ver := hi(regs.al);
       ver2 := lo(regs.al);
     end;
 end;

 procedure check_xms (VAR installed:boolean; VAR ver,ver2:byte); var
   regs  :  registers;
 begin
   regs.ax := $4300;
   intr($2F,regs);
   installed := regs.al = $80;
   if (installed = true) then
     begin
       regs.ax := $4310;
       regs.ah := $00;
       intr($2F,regs);
       ver := regs.ax;
       ver2 := regs.bx;
     end;
 end;

You were. Mostly. What you forgot was that when a real world book like PC
Interrupts says "Load the AX register with the value 4300h", it means to us
Pascal programmers "Load the AX variable with the value $4300". Note the dollar
sign. That means hexadecimal (like the little h on the end means hexadecimal to
assembly programmers).
