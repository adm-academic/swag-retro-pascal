For the case that some of your machines have UMBs available, I have a unit
that extends the heap into these UMB blocks completely transparent.
THe unit seems to work, I'd like to see any comments about bugs etc. on it.

    This unit was created to use the  high  memory  under  DOS  where
    LoadHi loads the TSRs etc. as extra heap. This was  possible  due
    to the revamped heap manager of Turbo  Pascal,  which  now  again
    uses MCBs to control its freelist instead of  an  array  of  8192
    pointers. I used this technique just like Himem / Quemm to insert
    a huge used block, the high DOS / BIOS area in the heap and  then
    to add the free RAN behind it. Now I have a maximum heap  size of
    700K, which is nicer than the old 640K  limit.  Note  that  using
    UseHi will not pay attention to the compiler $M settings in  your
    source. The memory is freed automatically by DOS, but  I  had  to
    adjust the MaxHeapxxx variable in the Memory unit, this is a word
    that contains the maximum heap size,  which  increased  by  using
    UseHi. If you don't need Turbo Vision, you can  remove  the  Uses
    Memory line and also remove the MaxHeapxxx adjustment.  But  with
    TVision, it will only work, if you have this line in it.

    The text variable HeapWalk is for debugging purposes, if you want
    to see a dump of the free blocks in the heap, you need to  assign
    and reset / rewrite the HeapWalk variable and then call ListWalk.
    Don't forget to close the HeapWalk variable again. It  will  dump
    the whole freelist into the file.

    This piece of code is donated to the public domain, but I request
    that, if you use this code, you mention me in the DOCs somewhere.
