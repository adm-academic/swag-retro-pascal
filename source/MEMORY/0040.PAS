Correct. Absolutely at the same address as the other variable.

At this time, BP won't let you add or subtract offsets from the address you
give to the Absolute clause. Unless possibly it's a constant address. In any
case, it's not ACCESSING memory linearly that is the problem, it's getting the
operating system or runtime library to ALLOCATE it linearly.

Protected mode has the WinAPI unit that lets you deal with huge memory blocks
and other stuff. That is what is needed.

In real mode all you can do is:
}

var p,p2,tmp:pointer;

begin  {make sure 2 memory blocks are linear}
 getmem(p,$C000);  {48K}
 getmem(p2,$C000); {96K total}
 while (seg(p2^)-seg(p^))*$1000+(ofs(p2^)-ofs(p^))<>$C000 do begin
  freeMem(p2,$C000);
  freeMem(p,$C000);
  writeln('Not linear... trying again.');
  getmem(tmp,1);
  getmem(p,$C000);
  getmem(p2,$C000);
  end;
 end;
