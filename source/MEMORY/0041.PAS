Have you checked out the Memory Unit that comes with TP 7 (maybe 6). It has
several procs that may help you out, notable  SetMemTop() which allows you
to decrease your heap on the fly. I haven't actually played with this
commands yet, but it may be worth your while to check'em out.}

   PS: PStruct;
begin
  New(PS);
  SetMemTop(HeapPtr);   {Without this, the shell fails}
  SwapVectors;
  Exec(GetEnv('Comspec'),'');
  SwapVectors;
  SetMemTop(HeapEnd);   {Restore your heap}
  Dispose(PS);
end.
