     Russ, you have to load AH with $88 before the Int 15 call, not
     after.  However, HIMEM hooks this interrupt anyway and only shows
     available extended memory, not installed memory.  Try the following
     program instead:
}
program show_ram;
const
  int15: longint = $f000f859;
var
  baseram,extram: word;
begin
  asm
    int   12h
    mov   baseram,ax
    mov   ah,88h
    pushf
    call  int15
    mov   extram,ax
  end;
  writeln('Base RAM = ',baseram,' Kbytes');
  writeln('Extended RAM = ',extram,' KBytes');
end.

{
This works on 286 cpu's and above since 8088/8086's don't have
extended memory.
