From the description DJ gave, I reconstructed it for you:
}

procedure SwapStackAndCallNear(Routine: Word;
                               SP: Pointer;
                               var Regs);
{
  Flags are saved (unchanged during routine),
  Stack is restored after completion,
  Registers AX,BX,CX,DX,SI,DI and ES destroyed.
}

Please test my InLine macro, and tell me if this works. Sometime soon I'll
try to experiment with PAUSEDEV myself (if I can find it again, that is ;-)
