   This program simply snapshots memory to disk.  It was developed so a user
from across the country could take a snapshot of his memory configuration and
present it for inspection.

   You'll need to change the "TotalRAM" constant if you have a system with
less than 640k of memory.

Version 1.00: released to the public domain on 27 August 1989.
   See above for the reason why this program was created.}
