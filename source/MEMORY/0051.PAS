The program StackUse below measures your EXACT stack usage
(REAL mode only). Make sure the constant Ssize is equal to the
actual physical stack size as defined with the $M directive or
in the Turbo Pascal IDE settings (the Options/MemorySizes menu).

For your own programs, you just need to call Initstack at the very
start, then call StackReport whenever you want - or calculate for
yourself, (Ssize-(VirginStack-StackLimit)) equals the number of
stack bytes actually used.

Sptr gives you the current stack pointer, and StackLimit is
a TP system variable (WORD) that contains the current bottom of
of the stack. StackLimit is usually zero, but some 'sneaky'
programs raise it so they can hide something there - for example,
c1;0compiling your program using the replacement run-time libraries
by Norbert Juffa can raise the StackLimit to 512.
The stack is filled from top to bottom, so a stack overflow
means Sptr <= StackLimit.
UseStack is just an example of a procedure that makes heavy
use of the stack.

This code can be freely included in any FAQ,
SNIPPETS, SWAG or what-have-you.
