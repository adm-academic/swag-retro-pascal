The first way is known to all serious TP programmers.
You could create large fragmental structure by control block.
Example:
}

Type
    Large =  Array [1 .. 65520] of Byte;
    PLarge = ^Large;
    Huge = Array [1 .. 16380] of Pointer; { control block }
    PHuge = ^Huge;
Var
   Hg : PHuge;
   MaxRow , MaxCol , r , c : Word;

begin
     Repeat ReadLn(MaxRow , MaxCol)
     Until (MaxCol > 0) and (MaxCol <= 65520) and
                              (MaxRow > 0) and (MaxRow <= 16380);
     GetMem(Hg , Sizeof(Pointer) * MaxRow);
     For r := 1 to MaxRow do GetMem(Hg^[r] , MaxCol);
     For r := 1 to MaxRow
     do For c := 1 to MaxCol
        do Hg^[r]^[c] := Random(255);
end.

This method creating huge structures is using Borland in object named
TColection.
This method has two defects.
 * You must use big control structure consists of pointers.
 * You haven't garant of unfrugmental of this structure.
This method have two advantages.
 * You can use standart pascal procedures & macros for operating with
   this structure (As Move, FillChar ets).
 * You can use standart TP heap menager for creating huge
   structure.

The second way for creating huge structure. It's my own method.
I use DOS memory menager.  I can create realy huge unfragmental
structure. It's more complicated way. I can't use standart TP
procedure & macros for operating with that structure, because
this structure greater than 64Kb. For remove huge structure I
write some procedure, function & inline macros. I used standart TP
heap menager for allocation small control structure and used
DOS memory menager for allocation huge data structure.
Example:
{$M 4096,10000,10000 <- It's very important option. Without
this option Your program should use all DOS memory for his TP
heap. You should write Your realy heap size. Use TpStack from
Turbo profesional for get this value.

{
   I don't want send more than 16Kb of my library. Because I don't test
   all procedure & function. But I can give You my idea.
   This way has one defect.
   * You should rewrite all low level memory access (As Move,
      FillChar ets.).
   This way has four advantages.
   * You can use all DOS memory functions: Allocation, Resize,
     Free (It's more powerfull that TP).
   * You recive paragraph align pointer.
   * You get unfragmental memory block.
   * You don't use big control structure.
