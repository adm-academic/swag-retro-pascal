It can use UMBs or the EMS page frame; that's no problem at all.  Just allocate
them to your program using DOS services, then fiddle with the heap manager
variables so that it thinks it's got a fragmented heap.  Here's some code I
wrote a long time ago to use the EMS page frame this way; you'll need to
provide some EMS control routines yourself if you don't have the Object
Professional library.  It was written for TP 6, but should work fine in TP/BP 7
real mode, because the heap manager is the same.
