 XDR> I'm currently developing an application that I would gladly spread in
 XDR> protected mode... But could someone explain to me what can I NOT do in
 XDR> DPMI pascal

This is actually explained quite clearly in Ch. 17 of the BP7 Language Guide.

The main difference is that memory is no longer yours to do with as you
please; you can only "touch" memory that has been allocated to your program.
This is where the "protected" in "protected mode" stems from.

The following is a rather simplified view of things, but it does illustrate
the general priciple:

In pmode a pointer such as ptr($B800, 0) does NOT point to memory location
$B800:0000. The segment part (called the "selector" in pmode), $B800,
is treated as an index into a system maintained table, which *does* contain
the actual physical memory location (called the "base"), and the number of
bytes allocated to that base (called the "limit"). This table is unavailable
to your program.
At the start of your program, all entries in this table are marked "not in
use" and therefore illegal.
During program execution, whenever you attempt to read or write Mem[S:O],
the CPU checks (in that table) to see if S is a legal index (i.e., if S is
a valid base), and if so, whether O is within the limit of that base.
If at least one of these checks fail, the memory access is invalid, and you
will be presented with run time error 216 a.k.a. the dreaded General
Protection Failure (GPF) a.k.a. Exception $0D.

 XDR> Ag: I can no more acces the screen at an Obsolute $b800:000 but at
 XDR> absolute Segb800:000, why?

Btw: ABSOLUTE SegB800:0 won't compile.
Use "mem[SegB800:0]" instead, or use a pointer, like so:

VAR VidMemStart: pointer;
BEGIN VidMemStart:=ptr(SegB800, 0) END;

and manipulate video memory using VidMemStart^.

The reason should now be clear: $B800 is almost certainly *not* a valid
selector. Since no one has asked the DPMI server to associate selector $B800
with a physical memory location, it is illegal.
You *can* use SegB800, as your program startup code asks the DPMI server to
associate SegB800 with video memory.

You should not pass pmode pointers to real mode routines nor the other way
around (they are invalid in the "receiving" mode).
It can be done, but you'll need the cooperation of the DPMI server.
Find a DPMI unit (I can't post mine, as it is commercial). Below you'll
find such a unit - I've never used it, so no guarantees.

Notes: - if you attempt to write to code segments, or read from invalid
         pointers, a GPF will result.
       - if you attempt to read an invalid stack element, you will receive
         an Exception $0C (Stack Fault), which BP will convert to run time
         error 202.
       - Exception 6 (Invalid Opcode) is not related to memory accesses.
         It means the CPU has received a couple of bytes which it cannot
         interpret as a valid instruction.
       - prior to distribution, be sure to read file DPMIUSER.DOC.
         You can find that file in archive DOC.ZIP on your BP7 distribution
         disks.

The above three exceptions are likely the only ones you'll see.

Happy programming,

Peter. }
