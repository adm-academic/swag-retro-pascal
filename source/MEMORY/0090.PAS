Thank you for so graciously accepting the terms before anyone wanted me
to post my much more elementary 16-bit version as below:
}
procedure move (var src, dest; count : word); assembler;

asm
  push ds
    mov bx, count
    mov cx, bx
    shr cx, 1

    les di, src
    lds si, dest
    rep movsw

    and bx, 1
    jz @NoMovsB
    movsb
   @NoMovsB: 

  pop ds
end;

I remember yours looking a little different then that, maybe I'm thinking 
of fillchar (later on)... but not to be picky, since dx isn't used, 
couldn't you use mov dx, ds and mov ds, dx instead of push and pop 
respectively?

Hmmm... you must have rewritten both of them since I last saw them, as I 
remember something utilizing adc in one of those... oh well, thse look 
more logical anyway :)

How about I put up my fillchar as well, just for comparison's sake (it's, 
once again, only 16-bit, but it seems to work just fine anyway :)

procedure FillChar (var src, dest; count : word; value : byte); assembler;

asm
  mov bx, count
  mov cx, bx
  shr cx, 1

  mov al, value
  mov ah, al

  les di, dest
  rep stosw

  and bx, 1
  jz @NoStosB
  stosb
 @NoStosB:
end;

In other words it's my move() only with ax = 257*value and, well, a fill
instead of a move. :)
