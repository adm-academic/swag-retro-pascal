 SB> i have a problem. I want it to show Three Choices Like This;


 SB> Choice #1
 SB> Choice #2
 SB> Choice #3

 SB>
 SB> I want Choice #1 to be in White, and the others to be In Darkgray, if
 SB> they  press down, it will make only #2 White, and the others Darkgray,
 SB> if they press Down again it will make only Choice #3 White, and it will
 SB> Tell Them Which  Choice they choosed on each one if they press enter.
 SB> So if they press Enter  while Choice #1 Was Highlighted, it would say
 SB> 'You Chose Choice Number 1'. and and it will Repeat when you Press the
 SB> arrow keys, untill they press Enter on  anyone of the Choice Choices...
