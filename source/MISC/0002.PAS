It's a bit round-the-block, but you might get some exercise out of it,
assuming you have the source code:

1) Smash the source into C With a code converter.

2) Declare the Procedures as `void far PASCAL' and the Functions as
   `appropriate_Type far PASCAL'.

3) Compile it With Turbo C or similar.
