Unit LongJump;

{ This Unit permits a long jump from deeply nested Procedures/Functions back }
{ to a predetermined starting point.                                         }

{ Whilst the purists may shudder at such a practice there are times when such}
{ an ability can be exceedingly useful.  An example of such a time is in a   }
{ BBS Program when the carrier may be lost unexpectedly whilst a user is on  }
{ line and the requirement is to "back out" to the initialisation reoutines  }
{ at the start of the Program.                                               }

{ to use the facility, it is required that a call be made to the SetJump     }
{ Function at the point to where you wish the execution to resume after a    }
{ long jump. When the time comes to return to that point call FarJump.       }

{ if you are an inexperienced Programmer, I do not recommend that this Unit  }
{ be used For other than experimentation.  Usually there are better ways to  }
{ achieve what you want to do by proper planning and structuring.  It is     }
{ rare to find a well written Program that will need such and ability.       }
