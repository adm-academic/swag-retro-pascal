PROCEDURE ICA(GetPut : boolean;
      var SourceDest);
{ DESCRIPTION:
    Gets or puts information in the Intra-Application Communications Area (ICA).
  SAMPLE CALL:
    ICA(True,MyVar);
    or
    ICA(False,MyVar);
  RETURNS:
    See notes (bellow).
  NOTES:
    These sixteen bytes, called the Intra-Application Communications Area
      (ICA) can be used by any program for any purpose, Usually it is used
      to pass data betwenn two or more programs. Not many programs use this
      area. If you wish to use this area, make sure checksums and signatures
      are used to insure the reliability of your data, since another program
      may also decide to use this area.
           [in The Assembly Language Database, Peter Norton]
    The incomming SourceDir variable may be of any type.
    Nevertheless, the size of that variable MUST be at least 16 bytes long,
      or unpredictable results may occur...
    The programer before changing this area contents, should keep its
      contents in a variable for later restore. It is not a very good ideia
      to not restore the contents before the program end, because that
      area may being used by another program. }
