  Well, I made a unit for that purpose, but my unit only tacks on 1K of
storage space... You can make it as large as you want it, but it'll be a
REAL time consumer and it might push your text editor to the limits (I'm
not sure if the IDE has a file size limit).

  Here it is (in a VERY shortened version )
}
unit inject1k;

interface
implementation
const doesnt_matter_what_this_is_called : boolean = false;

procedure never_really_call_this_procedure;
begin
  if doesnt_matter_what_this_is_called then
    inline( 228/229/230/231/231/233/234/  { this I use for a ID string }
            234/234/234/234/234/234/234/
            234/234/234/234/243/234/234/
{ repeat as many times until you get enough .. each '234/' is 1 byte }
            234/234/234/234/234/234/234/
            234/234/234/234/234/234/234/  { this is the actual 'junk' }
           ); { inline }
end; { procedure }

end. { unit }
{
  I only inject 1024 into my EXE file... If you want, you can make
identical units like that, but the DATA area will NOT be in one long
string unless all the bytes are in one unit.
  I use the ID string to correctly place the file pointer. Just open the
EXE, read in bytes until you get a 228. Read another, if it's a 229
etc.. Keep looping until you get a 228-229-230-231-232-233-234 and then
you can start reading/writing. It's by no means the easiest way, but I
prefer it over trying to append to the end. I tried that, but I kept
getting errors and such. As long as the PCX file is fairly small, you
won't have too much of a problem.
  I'm not sure what the chances are, they must be pretty slim to find a
string (228-234) one after the other in an EXE. If you think they are
higher, or whatever, just put your own in. You could probably even put
text in like this:
}
inline('D'/'A'/'T'/'A'/' '/'S'/'T'/'A'/'R'/'T'/'S'/' '/'H'/'E'/'R'/'E'/
111/111/111/111  { etc... } );
{
         I hope this helps, or gives you some ideas. Note, the unit will
be about TWICE as large as the number of bytes you inject (maybe 1000
more), but the EXE will only increse by the number you add. I'm pretty
sure that the extra bytes are just data/debug info in the TPU file.

interesting<<smile>>... i never thought of doing it like that.. hehe.. here's
a unit i got from this echo or the other PASCAL echo several years ago.. i've
used it in self-limiting programs (ones that only run a certain number of
times) and other programs that may be subject to hacking of various forms...
i've modified it slightly for my purposes...
