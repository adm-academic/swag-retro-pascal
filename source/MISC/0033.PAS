Just so happens I have been dealing With the same problem. I have
written a Procedure to show the "True" size of an EXE File. Knowing this
you can easily get to your "data area" by seeking past the "True" size.

  {$i+}   { io checking should be off }
  if (ioresult <> 0) then
    exesize:= 0
  else
  begin
    read(f,sz);
    close(f);
    With sz do
      exesize := remainder + (pred(pages) * 512);
  end;
end;

This thing reads the header of an EXE File and gets the info there. I
was amazed when I ran this on a bunch of progs and found how many have
data appended. Hope it helps. :)
