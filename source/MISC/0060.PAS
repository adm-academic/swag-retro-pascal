{
   There was a discussion about  how to trap  floating point errors
in  TP.  Here  is  the   solution that traps   any kind of run-time
errors.  The idea is not mine. I saw it in a russian  book about TP
and OOP.

   The idea is quite simple.  Instead of trying to trap all kind of
errors, we  can let TP to do  the job for  us.   Whenever  TP stops
execution of the  program ( because   of a run  time  error or just
because  the program  stops in a  natural  way )  it   executes the
default procedure of exit : ExitProc.  Then TP checks the status of
two variables from  the SYSTEM unit  : ErrorAddr and  ExitCode.  If
there was a run  time error then ErrorAddr  is not NIL and ExitCode
containes the run time error code. Otherwise ExitCode containes the
errorlevel  that  will be    set  for  DOS and  ErrorAddr  is  NIL.
Fortunatly  we can easily  redefine   the  ExitProc,   and  thus to
overtake the control from TP. The problem is that we got to be able
to get back or to jump to any point  of the program  ( even to jump
inside a procedure / function). The author of the book claimed that
he took his routines from Turbo Professional.

   Well, there are two files you are gonna need. Save the first one
as JUMP.PAS Compile it as a unit. The second one is a short program
that shows  how to use  it. It  asks for   two numbers, divides the
first  by the second and takes  a  natural logarithm of the result.
Try to divide by zero, logarithm of a negative number. Try entering
letters instead of numbers and see how the program recovers.

   The trapping   works  fine under Windows/Dos.   To  run  it with
WINDOWS recompile the JUMP unit for Windows target. Then add WinCrt
to the Uses statement and remove Mark/Release lines ( because there
is no Mark/Release for Windows ).
