Here's a programm that does that. It's a little bit strange, but I put
extra code so the board would not be passed as a parameter (since Turbo
Profiler said :"Hey, 75% of your run time goes in copy of the board").
The file is name REINES5.PAS (litterally QUEENS5.PAS) and it's limited
(so to say) to 64x64 boards (with 64 queens on it). It is fast enough.
