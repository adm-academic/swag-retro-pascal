function checkregister:boolean;
var
 f:file of regpass;
 p:regpass;
 a,x,y,z,c:word;
begin

  begin
   z:=z+p[a];
   x:=x XOR p[a];
   y:=y+NOT(p[a]);
   end;
 c:=z;
 z:=z MOD 256;
 x:=x MOD 256;
 y:=y MOD 256;
 checkregister:=false;

 if ((x=p[21]) AND (y=p[22])) AND (z=p[23]) then checkregister:=true;

This routine allows you to have both somebody's name and a checksum stored. 
If they don't match up, it appears that it isn't a registered copy.  You can 
stash whatever in the first 20 bytes, and the last three are reserved for a 
chacksum.  This is the routine that I use, and it seems to be pretty 
muck-proof;

You can write the routine to create the file and do the checksums yourself.
It's idioticly simple.  C-ya...
