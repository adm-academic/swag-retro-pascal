³ Now, just to bring this home, I want to make it take over the
³ debugging interrupts.  (INT 3, is it?)  I am just wondering if this
³ has been done and if anyone has some TP/TASM code already created for
³ this purpose.

in case the debugger executes an int1 or int 3, all you will get is the
message "OOPS". not really secure, but for most cases QUITE good enough.
