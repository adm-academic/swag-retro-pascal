It is possible to detect if your program is debugged. Debuggers use interrupt 3
for breakpoints. The following example will simply crash the program if its run
with Turbo Debugger, under DOS there's no problem.

CAUTION : this program wil crash if run under a debugger, including the
          IDE (when you make use of breakpoints)

Program DebugTest ;
Uses
  DOS ;
var
  OldInt3 : Pointer ;
{$F+}

Procedure Int3 ; assembler ;
ASM
end ;

Begin
  GetIntVec (3, OldInt3) ;
  SetIntVec (3, @int3) ;
  { Put breakpoint here }
  Writeln ('Breakpoint action ?') ;
  SetIntVec (3, OldInt3) ;
end.
