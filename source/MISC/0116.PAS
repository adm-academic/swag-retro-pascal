What am I doing here? Just looking for a push instruction. If {$G} on
constants are pushed with an immediate push instruction. Sounds
dificult? Well, just forget it, implement these functions in a unit
and you have your long-awaited test function.

I have some notes on my own code. If you're using my check-80X86 function
NEVER do the following things:
*)

if (OptionGOn = Goff) then
begin
  WriteLn('This code is compiled with $G+');
  Halt(2) {<<<<< PROBLEMS!!! }
end;
(*
Why?

If $G has been enabled you'll get:

push 2
call far HALT

And (as you noted) an 808X does not accept this.

Instead use this:
*)

if (OptionGOn = GOn) then
begin
  WriteLn('Option $G enabled message');
  Halt(Integer(OptionGOn)) { Or pass a variable }
end;

(*
In plain words: after checking the G-state with my function, don't call a
function with constant parameters. Always pass variables/function-results as
parameters.
This is not "portable":
*)

const
  ERROR_GERROR  = 2;
  ANOTHER_CONST = 3;

if { my test } then
begin
  IWantToExitRightNow(ERROR_GERROR, ANOTHER_CONST, 4, 6, 7);

end;

{ Instead try this: }

if { my test } then
begin
  IWantToExitRightNow(VarIndicatingError, VarForAnotherConst,
     FunctionCall4, FunctionCall6, VarContaining7)

end;

{
This is _only_ necessary in the "code" block immediately following my
function, not in your other code. By the way: I have written a unit for
detecting this $G-state. It's partly written in asm. This unit does not
require the "use" of other units.
