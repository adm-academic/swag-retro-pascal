   In the meantime the readers might want to play around with the following
code, that I think I originally picked up in this invaluable conference some
years ago (or it may have been the SWAG -- don't remember really). I've
altered the original code so it can be compiled without any other special
units but my cursorUnit, that comes next.

Very nice!  My algorithm grows walls, but your algorithm digs corridors.
Your algorithm also seems to generate more complicated mazes than mine.
My only concern is that it relies so heavily on recursion; you risk
running out of stack space.  Of course, with my algorithm, you allocate
lots of arrays that take up data segment ...

Thanks for posting it!

As I comprehend it, the maze-generating algorithm is like this:

- Draw a field composed entirely of walls.

- Select a random spot in the field to be your very first corridor spot.

- Here is the maze-digging routine:
  
  - (This routine takes two value parameters: the X and Y coordinates of
    your current location.)

  - If you can randomly select a valid location two units away from those
    X / Y coordinates (where "valid locations" are those that currently
    are walls and not corridors):
  
    - "Dig a corridor" from the X / Y location to that randomly-
      selected location.
    
    - Recursively call this routine; as parameters, pass the X and Y
      coordinates of that randomly-selected location.  (On the first
      pass, use that randomly-selected first corridor spot as the X and
      Y coordinates.)

- When the recursion ends, the maze is done.
