  From a single character input in ['A'..'Z'] a pyramid of chars is
  formed as follows:
                       A                             A
  ch1 := 'C' gives    ABA      ch1 := 'D' gives     ABA      etc.
                     ABCBA                         ABCBA
                                                  ABCDCBA   }
