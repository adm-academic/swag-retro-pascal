Err.. RACER programmed by Scott Tunstall 1994.
(When I first got me PC at the age of 22)

Update in March 95 (Also by Scott Tunstall) - to piss off the
B.Sc chaps. And what's more folks it's already on BBS's so
ripping off me code will mean I sue you for (C).

Renamed to The Dave Norrie Driving Simulator just to piss the c**t
right off!! :) sorry Dave mate but this is easily the best game
you'll play on your PC cos :

       (A) I programmed it
       (B) Your f***ing name is on it. :) :) :)

Even SHITTER than the lawnmower simulator.. it's me racing game
which has absolutely NO collision detection whatever. I done this
just for a laugh see?

And to practise assembler. Compared to me efforts now the assembler
code in this really SUCKS!! (But why should I optimize a piece of
shit like this? :) )

(And no commenting either.. tut tut)

Oh by the way Ronny seeing as you don't believe I wrote space lords
I thought I'd update me copy just for you... EAT YOUR WORDS

{    Here's a few possible additions for you sad fucks who
     actually like this trash:

     1. Collision detection (Not too good though - ruins the fun!)
     2. Graphics ! (No then again maybe not)
     3. Some sound (Keep it crap)
     4. Err.. playability?
