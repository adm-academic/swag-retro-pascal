{
Here's a solution! I'm using Borland Pascal 7.0 and MS-DOS, so see the
comments to adjust it to other compilers and platforms (especially the
Assembly language part...)

The code may be cut/copied and pasted anywhere you like it. No royalty is
needed. (I can't believe I said that, but it's true!)

Save the code as PUZZLE.PAS and create your own dictionary file as WORDS.DIC
in the current directory. A sample WORDS.DIC (generated from my big
WORDS.DIC using PUZZLE SHIFTED) is also given. Note that PUZZLE.PAS is
case-insensitive, you can use upper/lowercase. Every word should be on its
own line and must not have spaces in it. Sorting is optional, the output
depends on the order found in the file.

After you save PUZZLE.PAS and the sample WORDS.DIC, try PUZZLE SHIFT to get
13 words.

I have a big WORDS.DIC containing approximately 91,529 words. It is 979,045
bytes. PKZIP -ex produces a 251,926 bytes ZIP file. UUENCODE-ing the ZIP
file gives 6 files totaling 353,616 bytes. Anyone interested in it may mail
me. Note: The file was not created by me, although I was the one who sorted
it. I'm sure I found it somewhere on the net, but I forgot where exactly it was.

{ If you aren't using Borland Pascal 7.0 change the function header to:

    Function IsSolution(S, W : String) : Boolean;

(Borland Pascal 7.0 tip:)
Using Const on String arguments saves stack space and disables modifying the
String. (To modify Const S : String you use String((@S)^) in place of S.)

  S is the list of legal characters.
  W is a legal word from the dictionary file.

IsSolution(S, W) returns True if W can be formed from the letters in S.

This time S may have unused letters. If must use all letters from S change:
    IsSolution := True
(last line of function) to:
    IsSolution := S[0] = #0
or:
    IsSolution := S = ''
(The former is faster, the latter is simpler.)
