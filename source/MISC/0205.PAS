(* NOTE *)
Dice Object was created by Todd A. Jacobs and is hereby released
into the public domain.  Long live SWAG!

This unit is intended as a stand-alone object.  The idea was to
create a reusable object for dice games, such that types for 2d6,
2d10, 1d20, etc. (you role-playing gamers know what I mean) wouldn't
have to be created for each dice type.

The following sample code shows it's usage by writing a screenful of
random dice rolls:

	program DiceDemo;

	uses Dice;

	var
		d6: TDice;
                 i: byte;

	begin
		randomize;
		d6.init (3, 6);
		for i := 1 to 23 do
                    writeln (d6.roll);
		d6.done;
		readln;
	end. (*DiceDemo*)

No, it didn't have to be an object, but that's what I wanted to do.
Use it any way you like. =)

If you have any improvements to offer, please submit them to SWAG.
Thanks!
