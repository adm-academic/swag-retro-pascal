> Are you the DJ Murdoch that has a mouse fix for the TP IDE?

I wrote a little program to work around some bugs in some mouse drivers that
showed up in TP 6.  You can find it as "MOUSEFIX.ZIP" in various places.
Here's the source in its entirety; you'll need TurboPower's Object Professional
library to recompile, or you can supply your own replacements for the various
TSR support routines.
}
  program mousefix;

  { Program to intercept mouse calls; make sure that hide/show mouse calls
    balance between saves/restores of the mouse state }

  { Usage:  Run MOUSEFIX after loading your mouse driver, before running
            the TP6 IDE. It's a 27K TSR; if you like it, you'll probably
            want to rewrite it in assembler.
