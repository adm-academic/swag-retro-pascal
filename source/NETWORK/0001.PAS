{
±i'm trying to find a method by which i can, from within a TP Program,
±detect whether or not the NetWare shell has been loaded (Net3, NetX, or
±whatever); i've figured out how to determine if IPX is running, but
±can't seem to nail down the shell; the general idea is to detect IPX,
±detect the shell, determine whether or not the user is logged in, and if
±not, give them the oppurtUnity to do so; i've got most of the rest
±figured out, but can't find the shell; any help would be greatly
±appreciated
