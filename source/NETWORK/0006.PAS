The following Program is a slight modification of one posted by Zach
Linnet.  The problem is it doesn't lock the use of the File and allows
multiple PC's to access the File at the same time.  Also, it seems to
take input from the keyboard when it isn't supposed to and I am unable
to locate why.  How could I improve this to actually lock the File?
What if I just wanted to lock one or two Records?
