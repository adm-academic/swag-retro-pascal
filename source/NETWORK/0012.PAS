Subj: Re: Netware "User name"

  I need a way to get the current user name from the netware shell.
  For instance, if I'm logged into server MYSERVER as user SUPERVISOR,
  I need some way to get 'supervisor' as the user name...

This should do the job.  The two calls are "Get Connection Number" (DCh) and
"Get Connection Information" (E3h 16h), both from the Connection Services API.
The calls work with Advanced Netware 1.0 and all later versions.  Code tested
on 3.11 NetWare.

Beware the weak error-checking - the program doesn't check the version of
Netware, or even that the user is logged onto the network.
