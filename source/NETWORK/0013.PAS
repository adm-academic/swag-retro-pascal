     Yes there is.  Although this is in assembly, I'm sure you can dig
out what you need and convert it to Pascal or inline ASM. I've also
included for the more common multitaskers. I always try to check for
each at the beginning of a program so I can code to take advantage of
the features of whatever system it's operating under, or at least
prevent problems.

   Hope this helps. BTW, I don't know about the later versions of
Windows, but the older versions respected the Desqview installation
check.
