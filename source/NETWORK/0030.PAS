{
     A while back I posted a unit which allows one to interrface Pascal
programs to IPX.  Since I've had several people ask about how to use it,
I'll post this short example program now.  It should be enough to get
anyone started on sending packets.
     NOTE:  You must already have the IPX.PAS unit posted earlier in
this conference in order to use this program.  Also, this program uses
two NetWare functions to get the address of the remote user, so both
users must be logged in on the same server (but don't have to be on the
same network) to get the program to work.  The title of the program is
TALK.PAS.  In order to run the program you type TALK <username> from the
command line.

 This program sends packets between two users logged in
 to the same server.  This program is meant to be an example
 of how to send IPX packets over an IPX network and is not
 meant to be an actual utility.
