I've seen requests for these two procedures several times, and finally got
around to writing them in ASM.

(* Hex converts a number (num) to Hexadecimal.                      *)

(*    nib  is the number of Hexadecimal digits to return            *)

These procedures are fully optomized to my knowledge and have been tested
against normal Pascal routines that perform the same functions.  Test results
returned that Hex performed aprox. 2.14 times faster than it's Pascal
equivilent, and Binary performed aprox. 14 times faster than it's Pascal
equivilent.

Enjoy!
