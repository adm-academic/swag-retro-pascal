{
Hey, recently, I've developed a binary to integer, and integer to binary,
conversion operations.  This is the fastest way that I know how to write this,
short of assembly (which I do not know at current).  The original code was
much longer, and much slower, yet it worked too, just slower.  If you have any
suggestions, please let me know, I'm curious to see the results.  (And, please
let me know if you find a use for this source.  Right now, I only use it in
one of several units I've written, to view binary files.)

My programming style is very organized, so it shouldn't be too hard to follow.
