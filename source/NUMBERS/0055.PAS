Here is something that may help you a little. It works fine on my
PC with one small proviso. If you specify permutations of 8
objects taken 8 at a time (what you want ...) then the program
runs out of heap space. Try it will smaller numbers first - like
permutations of 5 objects taken 3 at a time. This will show you
how it works. You can then try to modify it so that it will not
run out of memory generating the 40320 permutations that you are
looking for.

  Program perms, written by Clive Moses. This program will
  generate all permutations of n objects, taken r at a time,
  memory allowing.

  Challenge: try to modify the program so that it will not
  guzzle massive amounts of memory generating its output.

program perms;

{ Program to generate permutations of n objects, taken m at a time.
  For test purposes: m <= n <= 8. The program, as implemented here,
  effectively uses a 'breadth-first' algorithm. If it could be changed
  to run in a 'depth-first' fashion, it would not be necessary to
  store all of the intermediate information used to create the
  permutations. A 'depth-first' algorithm might have to be recursive
  however.
