this Really stimulated me so I sat down and implemented the following *without*
messing around in DRIVERS.PAS in -believe it or not- 15 minutes!  :-)))

For convenience I copied the first three menus from my diskcopy clone so don't
get confused about the items :-).  This Program does not emulate Completely
Windows' behaviour, however, it's a good start. Tell me if this is what you
wanted! I didn't test it excessively but it does work in this fairly simple
Program For activating menus by <Alt>. The only thing not implemented is
'closing' the menu bar by a second <Alt> stroke.
