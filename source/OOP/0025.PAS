somebody asked For a inputline For passWords. I have such one, but I've
forgotten WHICH discussionlist... so I'll mail it to the above lists, I
know it's one of it, and know it can be interesting For somebody else.

What I have done is overriden the Draw-Procedure For the inputline to draw
only ***'s instead of the right Characters.  The solution I gave yesterday
was not quitte correct: I used the Procedure SetData to put the *'s into the
Data^-field, but that Procedure calls the Draw-Procedure itself so you'll
get an infinite loop and a stack-overflow error. Now I put the *'s direct to
the Data^-field, I don't think it can give problems.
