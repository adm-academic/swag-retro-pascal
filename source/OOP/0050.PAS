I have one program with the same problem, and I can suggest two more ways to do
what you want:
4.  A field in the collection saying which kind of sort you want, and a Resort
method.  The KeyOf and/or Compare methods look at this field to decide how two
records compare, and the Resort method re-inserts everything after you change
the field, so it ends up in the correct order.
5.  A non-method SortCollection function, that takes a Compare function as a
procedural parameter.  You can use a TCollection if you're not interested in
the search functions, or some variation on 4 if you are.

I don't know which you'll find best.  Depends on your taste.  Here's some code
that I use; you may want to borrow from it.

    Assumes that pointers point to pointers, i.e. links should be the first
    element of records in the list.
    N.B.  If enough memory is available, it seems to be faster to make the list
    into an array, use arr_sort, and then un_make the array when there are
    more than about 100 records.
