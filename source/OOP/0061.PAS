Normally a dialog can handle some 4 types of events - that is END the dialog
with the return code of your event - I'm guessing that you want a dialog with
some ten buttons or something like that ?
I've designed a dialog decendor that will take up to 16k buttons

    EndModal(Event.Command);
    ClearEvent(Event);
   end;
  end;
 end;
end;

end.
{
Use the ppeldialog instead of the pdialog

Add a call to addcmd() for every command you want the dialog to exit with
normally a dialog will end for cmok,cmcancel,cmyes and cmno - those dont need
to be added !
