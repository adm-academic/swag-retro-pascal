Try this, the code is ugly but it works!
{Written, Tested and Compiled with BP 7.x}

uses crt;

          Area must be BETWEEN Lo and hi otherwise it would have
          been found by the first POS check. So if RangeLo is > Area

            2- No match was found, in which case List is non-empty.
