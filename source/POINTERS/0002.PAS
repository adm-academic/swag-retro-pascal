{
The following is the LinkList Unit written by Peter Davis in his wonderful
but, unFortunately, short-lived newsletter # PNL002.ZIP.  I have used this
Unit to Write tests of three or four of the Procedures but have stumped my toe
on his DELETE_HERE Procedure, the last one in the Unit.  I will post my tests
in the next message For any who may wish to see it:  Pete's Unit is unmodified.
 I almost think there is some kind of error in DELETE_HERE but he was too
thorough For that.  Can you, or someone seeing this show me how to use this
Procedure?  It will help me both With Pointers and With Units.

Here is the Unit:

        current." You may need to run that through your head a few times
        beFore it clicks, but hearing it in English might make it a bit
