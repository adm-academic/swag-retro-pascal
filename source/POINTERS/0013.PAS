³ I'm trying to understand the rudiments of linked lists

³ 4) What are common uses for linked lists?  Is any one particular form
³    (oneway, circular etc ) preferred or used over any other form?

One use is to maintain queues.  New people, requests, or jobs come in at
the end of the line (or break in with priority), but once the head of
the line has been serviced, there is no need to maintain its location in
the queue.  I wrote the following last semester:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
  Maintains a queue of jobs and priorities of those jobs in a linked list.
  The user will be prompted for job number and priority and can list the
  queue, remove a job from the front of the queue (as if it ran), and stop
  the program.  A count of jobs outstanding at the end will be displayed. }

  if Start = NIL then
  begin
    Start := this;   {Points to node just built}
    Start^.Link := NIL; {Is end of list}
  end
  else    {Chain exists, find a place to insert it}
  if comprec.Priority > Start^.Priority then
  begin
    this^.Link := Start;     {Prep for a new beg of chain}
    Start := this
