  Patterned after the list processing facility in Simula class SIMSET.
  Simula fans will note the same naming conventions as Simula-67.

  Written by Bill Zech @CIS:[73547,1034]), May 16, 1989.

  The Links unit defines objects and methods useful for implementing
  list (set) membership in your own objects.

  Any object which inherits object <Link> will acquire the attributes
  needed to maintain that object in a doubly-linked list.  Because the
  Linkage object only has one set of forward and backward pointers, a
  given object may belong to only one list at any given moment.  This
  is sufficient for many purposes.  For example, a task control block
  might belong in either a ready list, a suspended list, or a swapped
  list, but all are mutually exclusive.

  A list is defined as a head node and zero or more objects linked
  to the head node.  A head node with no other members is an empty
  list.  Procedures and functions are provided to add members to the
  end of the list, insert new members in position relative to an
  existing member, determine the first member, last member, size
  (cardinality) of the list, and to remove members from the list.

  Because your object inherits all these attributes, your program
  need not concern itself with allocating or maintaining pointers
  or other stuff.  All the actual linkage mechanisms will be
  transparent to your object.

  *Note*
          The following discussion assumes you have defined your objects
          as static variables instead of pointers to objects.  For most
          programs, dynamic objects manipulated with pointers will be
          more useful.  Some methods require pointers as arguments.
          Example program TLIST.PAS uses pointer type variables.

  Define your object as required, inheriting object Link:

                type
                        myObjType = object(Link)
                                xxx.....xxxx
                        end;

  To establish a new list, declare a variable for the head node
  as a type Head:

                var
                        Queue1        :Head;
                        Queue2        :Head;

        Define your object variables:

                var
                        X    : myObjType;
                        Y    : myObjType;
                        Z    : myObjType;
                        P    :^myObjType;

        Make sure the objects have been Init'ed as required for data
        initialization, VMT setup, etc.

                        Queue1.Init;
                        Queue2.Init;
                        X.Init;
                        Y.Init;
                        Z.Init;

        You can add your objects to a list with <Into>:
        (Note the use of the @ operator to make QueueX a pointer to the
         object.)

                begin
                        X.Into(@Queue1);
                        Y.Into(@Queue2);

        You can insert at a specific place with <Precede> or <Follow>:

                        Z.Precede(@Y);
                        Z.Follow(@Y);

        Remove an object with <Out>:

                        Y.Out;

        Then add it to another list:

                        Y.Into(@Queue1);

        Note that <Into>, <Precede> and <Follow> all have a built-in
        call to Out, so to move an object from one list to another can
        be had with a single operation:

                        Z.Into(@Queue1);

        You can determine the first and last elements with <First> and <Last>:
        (Note the functions return pointers to objects.)

                        P := Queue1.First;
                        P := Queue1.Last;

        The succcessor or predecessor of a given member can be found with
        fucntions <Suc> and <Pred>:

                        P := X.Pred;
                        P := Y.Suc;
                        P := P^.Suc;

        The number of elements in a list is found with <Cardinal>:

                        N := Queue1.Cardinal;

        <Empty> returns TRUE is the list has no members:

                        if Queue1.Empty then ...

        You can remove all members from a list with <Clear>:

                        Queue1.Clear;

        GENERAL NOTES:

                The TP 5.5 type compatibility rules allow a pointer to a
                descendant be assigned to an ancestor pointer, but not vice-versa.
                So although it is perfectly legal to assign a pointer to
                type myObjType to a pointer to type Linkage, it won't let
                us do it the opposite.

                We would like to be able to assign returned values from
                Suc, Pred, First, and Last to pointers of type myObjType,
                and the least fussy way is to define these pointer types
                internal to this unit as untyped pointers.  This works fine
                because all we are really doing is passing around pointers
                to Self, anyway.  The only down-side to this I have noticed
                is you can't do:  P^.Suc^.Pred because the returned pointer
                type cannot be dereferenced without a type cast.
