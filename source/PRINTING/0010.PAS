I am trying to figure out how to trap errors as they occur in my
Program and send messages to the user.. The most common error would be a
failed attempt to print but I don't know how to not stop the Program
when an error occurrs. You see, I don't want to have an {$I-},{$I+}
after every time the Printer prints..


not having any details of what you are doing, I'll take a stab in the dark.
Have an output routine and pass it a String.  The output routine would take
the String and sent it to the Printer.  ( Since you mentioned Printer, I
assume this is where you wish to send all output.)  Now have an output routine
For the screen.  Ah heck, here's an example. <g>  This is some code I wrote to
output Various things to the Printer.  No doubt some will claim to have better
solutions.  That's fine, but here's mine.  There is a routine you will see
called OUTCON(s : String; CH : Char);  It is a routine to send output to the
screen and inForm the user that there is a problem.  of course that's a
different topic then sending output to the Printer.  Hope this helps.
