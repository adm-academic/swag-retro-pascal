{
 EPSON Printer. I'm using TP7.0. Everythings works fine except one
 situation that occured when a Character 26 (Ctrl-Z which is Eof) is in

This may be the easy way out, but why not just use BIOS interrupt $17?
It's probably slower, but it'll work.

Function InitPort (PortNum : Byte) : Byte; {returns status}

  For Count := 1 to Len do

        Regs.AL := ^Where[Count];
        end;
  end;

InitPort returns
   144 Printer OK
    24 Printer not OK
   184 Printer is off
