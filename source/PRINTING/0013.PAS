{Your're in luck, I just got a new Printer and started writing routines to
control it (TFDD etc..). These are probably the most important ones:



 note: This routines are not throughly tested on Various Printers.
       Thus it may of may not work on your Type of Printer.
       But, as a rule, experiment With it and have fun............}
