The Objective is to intercept when the Printer is off-line, and give the
user a reminder to turn the Printer on-line, and press any key to resume
printing.

I Realize this is most certainly an FAQ, and I have found some source
code on Timo's site For TP 5.5 that I have modified (see below), but
there is not much talk anymore about TP 3.0.

Anyway, to avoid making a lot of changes to my source code, I thought I
would reWrite the LstOut Procedure (which according to the manual, is
called by routines accessing the LST: device) as shown at the end of
the following listing.  This is inefficient, since it is being called
for each Character that is output to the Printer.  Does anybody have a
better suggestion?  I might add the way it is now, if an off-line
signal is detected, the LstOut will only print the first Character
('t') in the Write(lst,'test') in the main Program, With the 'est'
going to the screen.  if I remove the statements in the While loop of
LstOut, then all of 'test' goes to the Printer, but it defeats my
purpose of giving the user a message.
