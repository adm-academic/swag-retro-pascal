This is the traditional quick and dirty way to thwart PrintScreen:

mem[$0050:0000] := 1;

$0050:0000 is the PrintScreen status byte.  It is set to 1 while
PrintScreen is in operation.  If the PrintScreen button is hit
while the screen is already being printed, the print screen routine
does nothing.  By setting the status byte to 1 yourself, you fool
the PrintScreen routine into thinking the screen is already being
printed and it will terminate without doing anything until you
jiggle the status byte back to the "correct" setting.

Set the status byte back to 0 (mem[$0050:0000] := 0) at the end of
your program so your users will be able to use PrintScreen after
your program has terminated.
