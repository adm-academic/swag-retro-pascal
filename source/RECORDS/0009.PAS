 No.....You could:
}

Procedure DelRec(RecIdx : LongInt);
Var
  Count,
  RecNo : LongInt;
  IFile : File of ItemRec;
  Item : ItemRec;

begin
  Assign(IFile,'Tmp.Dat'); Reset(f);   { assuming it exists }
  Seek(IFile,idx);                     { assuming recidx exists }
  RecNo := FileSize(f) - idx - 1;
  For Count := idx to RecNo do
  begin
    Seek(IFile,Count+1);
    Read(IFile,Item);        { read next rec }
    Seek(IFile,Count);
    Write(IFile,Item);       { overide prev rec }
  end;
  Seek(IFile,RecNo);                       { seek to last Record }
  Truncate(IFile);                     { truncate rest of File }
  Close(IFile);
end;

When you initialize new Variables....find the Non Active Record and assign
your File index Variable to that record!
