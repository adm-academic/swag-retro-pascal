Here's a neat little ditty I converted from a C++ tip I saw in a mag a few
years ago.  It tests to see if its own output has been redirected and
returns a 1 if TRUE (redirected) or a 0 if FALSE (not redirected). This
function includes a sample prog that demonstrates its use. SIDE NOTE: I
put this function in the U_FILE.pas.tpu for use with all of my home-grown
file related functions and procedures.

TEST WITH: Test_Red (enter)
   [you should see a NOT REDIRECTED msg, 10 lines and a FINISHED msg.]

TEST WITH: Test_Red > this.dat (enter)
   [you should see a REDIRECTED msg, (no lines) and a FINISHED msg
    and the output of the lines will be in the this.dat file]
}

program test_red;

{$A+,B-,D-,E-,F-,G-,I+,L-,N-,O-,P-,Q-,R-,S+,T-,V+,X-}
{$M 1024,0,655360}
