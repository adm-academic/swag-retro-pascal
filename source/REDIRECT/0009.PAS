    The problem is that Pkzip sends output through a different chanel than TP
uses for screen writes. Actually, if you set up a window as above, then hook
up Int29 and replace Normal Int29 code by simply using Write(register al),
then your output will go through TP's IO routines and will respect the window
coordinates. Here ya go! Written, Compiled and Tested using BP 7.x
