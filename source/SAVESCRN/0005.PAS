The Text you see displayed on the screen can be captured to a Variable
and subsequently restored through direct screen reads/Writes.  Video
memory is located (on most systems) at $B800 For color and $B000 on
monochrome adapters.  Each screen location consists of two Bytes: 1) the
Foreground/background color of the location, and 2) the Character at the
location.

The following Program Writes a screen full of 'Text', captures this
screen to a Variable (VidScreen), Writes over top of the current screen,
then restores original screen stored in VidScreen.
