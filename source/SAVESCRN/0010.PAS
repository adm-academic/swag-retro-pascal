The TSR part would be the hard part, the writing the screen to a File
would be easy.

I wrote this little prog just now, not incredibly great but might
actually work and probably will do the job...

Be careful as it doesn't check For Dos reentrancy and you might hang
your computer if you try to capture a screen While Dos is doing
something else...
