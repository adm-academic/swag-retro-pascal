:   Is there a way to save the current text screen so you can call it
: up later? (ie: Either save the screen so you can display something else
: in text, then bring back the first page, or to display graphics, then
: bring back the old text screen.)  Also, is there a way to dumb the screen
: to disk?

Here's the stuff i use... (It works from TP 4.0 and up)

Here's how you save a screen...

      With OriginalScreen do
        Begin
        X := WhereX; {save the x,y cursor positions...}
        Y := WhereY - 1;
        SaveScreen(Screen) {then the screen}
        End;

Here's how you restore a screen...

    With OriginalScreen do
      Begin
      RestoreScreen(Screen); {restore the screen}
      GotoXY(X, Y) {go back to the orig. cursor position}
      End;

:   While we're at it, I might as well get all my questions out of my
: system :)  First, is there a way to stop the program from crashing if
: someone enters a character instead of an integer (or any incompatible
: data types?)  I've been looking around but havn't found anything...

The best way is to read the number in as a string (characters), then use
the procedure Val(), to convert it from a character string to numeric.

: And lastly, how do you stop the program from crashing if a user enters
: a filename to load, and it doesn't exist?  I think this has something
: to do with the doserror (is that the function name?  Don't recall offhand)
: but I couldn't get it to work.

Check to see if the file exists, before you open it (Reset)...  Here's a
quick function..

Function Exists(FileName: String): Boolean;

  Begin
    Exists := FSearch(FileName, '') <> ''
  End;
