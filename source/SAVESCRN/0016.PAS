UNIT ScrStuff;

INTERFACE

USES Dos, Crt;

CONST VideoSegment : WORD = $B800;

TYPE  WindowREC    = ARRAY[0..4003] of BYTE;

PROCEDURE SaveWindow(VAR Wind:WindowREC; X1,Y1,X2,Y2:INTEGER);
PROCEDURE RestoreWindow(Wind:WindowREC);

IMPLEMENTATION

PROCEDURE CheckVideoSegment;
BEGIN
  IF (MEM[$0000:$0449]=7) Then VideoSegment:=$B000 else VideoSegment:=$B800;
END;


{ NOTE: SaveWindow does not clear the area that it saves.  It simply saves
  this data to an array.  Thus, in order to do what was stated above, you
  would simply define two variables of type WindowREC in your program, and
  save the first screen and the second screen into them.  Then whenever you
  needed to put them on the screen, you could use RestoreWindow to do so.
  NOTE: RestoreWindow does not clear the contents of the WindowREC variable
  passed to it, therefore this is possible.                                  }

{ ADDITIONAL NOTE:  SaveWindow and RestoreWindow do NOT save your window size
  or cursor position.  If you wish to modify it to do so, I would suggest
  increasing the WindowREC variable to ARRAY[0..4009] of BYTE, then place
  the window size and cursor position in the last 6 bytes.

  Current Window Size:

  x1:=LO(Windmin)+1;
  y1:=HI(Windmin)+1;
  x2:=LO(Windmax)+1;
  y2:=HI(Windmax)+1;

  Cursor position (window relative);

  x:=wherex;
  y:=wherey;
