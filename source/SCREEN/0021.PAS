Succ and Pred are faster for byte-sized ordinals (at least in TP 6.0)
than +1 and -1. The same for word-size. See, with +1 and -1, the byte
gets converted into a word first, but with Succ() and Pred() it
stays a byte... Inc(I) is faster than I:=I+1 or I:=Succ(I) stuff in 6.0
but I think 7.0+ optimize them all to the same code...not sure, I don't
have 7.0...8(

Actually the fastest part of what I did is to pre-calculate the
attribute as the hi byte of a word, and use word stores instead of byte
stores. Could be done alot faster in assembly (don't access any
memory-based variables that way, it's all in registers..8)

Here is a direct screen write unit I wrote in BASM. VERY fast...

{$A-,B-,S-,V-X+}
unit Direct;
interface

CONST
 vSeg:word=$B800;  {change for mono}

VAR
  VMode   : BYTE ABSOLUTE $0040 : $0049; { Video mode: Mono=7, Color=0-3 }
  ScrCols : WORD ABSOLUTE $0040 : $004A; { Number of CRT columns (1-based) }

{in following parms, s=source,d=destination,n=count, words are offsets
 into video memory (you calculate them with ((y*80+x)*2)}
{I did this mainly so less parms would have to be sent, as TP does a
 good job of the arithmetic for that expression...Oh well if you really
 don't like it I could make these use x and y coords, but this was
 basically chopped from another project of mine..}

procedure moveScr(s,d,n:word);    {one part of screen to another}
procedure toScr(var s;d,n:word);  {from string to video ram}
procedure toScrA(var s;d,n:word;a:byte); {ditto with attribute also}
procedure fillScr(d,n:word;c:char);      {mainly useful for rows}
procedure fillAttr(d,n:word;a:byte);     {ditto}

{ I added the following to make this GREAT code more useful for us hackers !!}

END.



Keep in mind these are VERY low-level and aren't necessarily gonna be
easy to work with but they are, by god, FAST.

These don't either (cursor? who needs it!)

QWrite'll work a little faster now, anyway...
