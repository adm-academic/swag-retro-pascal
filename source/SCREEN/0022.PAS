Try this Chris;

Procedure DVWRITE(X,Y:word;S:String;Back,Fore,BLNK:byte);
Var
I,I2:integer;
begin
   If (X>80) or (Y>25) or (X<1) or (Y<1) then Exit;
   If X+Length(S)>81 then Exit;
   DEC(X);
   DEC(Y);
   I2:=0;
   For I:= 0 to Length(S)-1 do
     begin
       Mem[$B800: (160 * y)+(x*2)+I2]:=Ord(S[I+1]);
       Mem[$B800: (160 * y)+(x*2)+I2+1]:=BLNK+(Back SHL 4)+Fore;
       INC(I2,2);
     end;
End;

This is a direct video write, and can not scroll the screen.
  Valid range X = 1..80  Y= 1..25
If you like take out the DEC(X&Y) and you can use 0..79 0..24

Should do the trick for you.
