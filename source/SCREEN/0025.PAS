function GetChar(x, y: integer): char;  (* $B000 for mono *)
var screen: array[1..25, 1..80] of word absolute $B800:0000;
begin
  GetChar := char(screen[x][y] and $FF);
end;

function GetTextColor(x, y: integer): integer;  (* $B000 for mono *)
var screen: array[1..25, 1..80] of word absolute $B800:0001;
begin
  GetTextColor := integer(screen[x][y] and $FF);
end;

  This is not the answer to your problem, but I'm sure it will help. All you
have to do (I *think*) is write back to the screen variable (BIOS). Keep in
mind that X and Y are in DOS format. For some reason, DOS's X-Axis is
vertical and Y-Axis is horizontal; CRT.GotoXY reverses that.
  Sorry I couldn't help further...

... Only reasonable people agree with me.
