This will do what you ask. There is no checking of the vidseg since it is
assumed that if you want to Write in color that you are using a color monitor:
}

Procedure WriteColorAt(X, Y : Byte; St : String; Attr : Byte);
Var
  Count : Byte;
begin
  For Count := 1 to Length(St) do
  begin
    Mem[$B800 : 2 * (80 * (Y - 1) + X + Count - 2)] := Ord(St[Count]);
    Mem[$B800 : 2 * (80 * (Y - 1) + X + Count - 2) + 1] := Attr;
  end;
end;

begin
  WriteColorAt(34, 12, 'Hello World!', $4E);
end.
