{
I use alot of line draws and some text on the screen....the lines come out
first and then the text a second or two later....is there a way so that the
whole output comes at once.  I tried Setvisualpage and setactivepage but the
the whole output screen is off.

        To Turn On/Off the Screen you may use these procedure
}
Procedure OnScreen;
Begin
     Port[$3c4]:=1;
     Port[$3c5]:=Screen_AttriBute_Tempolary;
end;

Procedure OffScreen;
Begin
     Port[$3c4]:=1;
     Screen_Attribute_Tempolary:=Port[$3c5];
     Port[$3c5]:=Screen_AttriBute_Tempolary or $20;
end;
