These last two are the interesting ones. LastRow is set to rows-1 on newer
bios's and by up-to-date programs that tweak the CRTC. Otherwise it will
contain 0, meaning 25 lines, for older Bios's

There's a wealth of information up there, man.

And I think this:
}
function ScrnLines:word;begin
 if lastRow=0 then lastRow:=24;   {set in case BIOS doesn't}
 scrnLines:=lastRow+1;
 end;


{Untested but should work.}
