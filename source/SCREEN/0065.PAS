Ouch. You screwed up there... This should do it:

(and I DON'T want some optimizations as 'shl ax,5' is faster than 'mov cl,5;
shl ax,cl'. It is coded in this way to ensure downward compatiblity. Replace
TextVidMem with either 0b000h or 0b800h, depending on your screen.)

      Function ReadCharThingy(x, y : Word) : Word; Assembler;
       Asm
        dec   x
        dec   y

        mov   ax,y
        mov   cl,5
        shl   ax,cl
        mov   si,ax
        mov   cl,2
        shl   ax,cl
        add   si,ax
        shl   x,1
        add   si,x

        mov   ax,TextVideoMem
        push  ds
        mov   ds,ax
        lodsw
        pop   ds
       End;
