Ok, without even going back to my compiler I can improve yer design.  i
forgot that on 386 and up that a mov [addr],al is faster than a single
stosb etc, so that was likely my largest time deficit.  Yours is the
Imul.  I'll add the color into mine, but I thought that passing up one
less param MIGHT increase the speed slightly.

ugh, comments.  You freaking PD coder, you.  You probably like windows
too huh?  This is the only section that I have improved on yer design.
I only discovered the optimize cause I was writing a faster putpixel.


Questions/comments:

    Xor CH,CH

You don't need this line at all.  that's 2 opcode tiks for me.
(ahhhh, obsessed)


Is "mov cl, byte ptr ds:[si]" any slower than "mov cl,[si]" ?

I know that "add di,2" is faster than "inc di;inc di" and
"dec cl" is better than "dec cx" and
"xor cx,cx" is faster than "mov cx,0"

                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^,
see that's the problem right there.  It should read: 'Jamie - coder god'

The only differences between our code:
  I used lodsb/stosw out of lasyness.
  You used xor ch,ch
  You used imul where I did shifts ( faster, but not the slowest part of
                                     the code, so not a big deal )
