                  X,Y       = location to begin writing string to screen.  If
                              the pattern begins with an 'X', this WILL be
                              taken into account and will advance one space.
                  Colr      = attribute of DispStr.
                  FChar     = Filler character for strings that don't complete
                              the pattern.
                  Patrn     = Template for writing string to screen.
                              Essentially, the only character required in this
                              template is the 'X', to show where a character
                              is NOT displayed.
               *)

  (* This procedure will write DispStr to the screen, following the guidelines
     given in Patrn.  For example, calling

           WriteP ('40312345',10,11,7,'_','X###XX###X####');

     will display:

            403  123 45__
           ^advancing space

     on the screen.  Of course, the '(   )    -' would make it complete, but
     that's just an example.
