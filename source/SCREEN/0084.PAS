UNIT FWColor;
{ This unit prints a string using John O'Harrow's FWrite and  }
{ has the ability to change color from within the string. The }
{ demo program is at the end of this unit.                    }

{ Thanks go to -> John O'Harrow <- for his "Universal FastWrite"   }
{ routine! Compilation of this unit requires his FWrite unit       }
{ found in SWAG9411 in SCREEN.SWG (Love the new format SWAG Team!) }

{ Possible enhancements:                             }
{  - Use a different character for the color marker. }
{  - Optimizations.                                  }
{  - Use character equivalent of FastWrite(?)        }

{ Notes:                                                    }
{  - Coordinates are *not* zero based as in the FWrite,     }
{    unit, the upper left corner is (1,1).                  }
{  - The marker character is ASCII character 0, hopefully,  }
{    this will not interfere with anything.                 }
{  - Sorry for the Boolean and type-casting in the demo,    }
{    I didn't feel like doing the math for the attributes,  }
{    and type-casting makes things faster when converting   }
{    between similar types, i.e. Char <--> Byte.            }
