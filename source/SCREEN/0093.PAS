{
{TEXT EFFECTS, otherwise known as TextFX, is a pascal unit, created in
{TURBO Pascal 4.0".  It's sole purpose is to add a little flair to text
{based pascal programs.  This is done via binary files, that can be made
{in pascal and saved to disk using the included SaveScreen procedure, or
{made in any text image design program that will save its data as a binary
{file, such as "TheDraw", by TheSoft Programming Services.
{
{
{
{This is a first release, and as such, is not certified to be error free
{and I shall take no responsibility for ANY damages caused by using this
{Unit.
{
{To all programmers:  This unit isn't all that fancy (YET) but, if it
{helps you to make a living, I'd appreciate it if you'd help me make my
{own.  Ideally this would be entail recognition in your final product, as
{well as a financial contribution that reflects how useful/profitable you
{found the unit to be.  Also acceptible would be one or the other as both
{are of great help.  ThanX.
{
{I am always looking for more text effects for upcoming versions, so if
{you think of something, drop me a line.  Don't forget to include your
{name or I won't be able to give you any credit for it.  Please note that
{credit will be given only once for each effect.  If two messages com in
{detailing the same effect, credit will go to the first I come across.
