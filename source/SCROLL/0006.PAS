The easiest way to do it is to set DirectVideo to False (if you are using
the Crt Unit).  This disables direct Writes to the screen, meaning that
the BIOS does screen writing, and the BIOS works in just about every
screen mode.  Then, you can just use Write and WriteLn to display Text
Characters (I think GotoXY will even work).  As For scrolling...
Since mode 13h ($13) has linearly addressed video memory (just a run
of 64,000 contiguous Bytes), do something like this:

this is untested, but it might actually work  :')

        'than 40 Characters long so the scrolling can be demonstrated.';

    Move(Mem[$A000 : curLine * 320 + 1], Mem[$A000 : curLine * 320], 319);
  { clear the trailing pixels }
  For curLine := (msgRow * 8) to (msgRow * 8) + 7 DO
    Mem[$A000 : curLine * 320 + 319] := 0;

    MOV AX, $13

  DirectVideo := False;
  GotoXY(1, msgRow + 1);
  Write(Copy(myMessage, 1, 40));
  { 'myMessage' must be a String With a Length > 40 }
  For xpos := 41 to Length(myMessage) do
  begin
    For sx := 0 to 7 do

    Write(myMessage[xpos]);

This may not be very efficiently coded.  As well, it could benefit from
an Assembler version.  But it should at least demonstrate a technique
you can learn from.  }
