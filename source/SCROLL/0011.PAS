I tested the single line scroller, and it worked. (Delayed 50 instead of 10)
(make the constant a string to compile it).

Now a simple scroll command for the entire screen (up)
}
Move(Mem[Vidseg,160],Mem[Vidseg,0],3840);     or just writeln
{
entire screen(down)
}
Move(Mem[Vidseg,0],Mem[Vidseg,160],3840);
{
entire screen(left)
}
Move(Mem[Vidseg,2],Mem[Vidseg,0],3998);
{
then write all characters that are new in the right column

entire screen(right)
}
Move(Mem[VidSeg,0],Mem[VidSeg,2],3998);
{
then write all characters in new left column
}
