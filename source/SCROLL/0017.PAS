These procedures scroll the text in the window with the upper righthand
corner being (x1,y1) and the lower lefthand corner being (x1,y2).  The text
will not scroll outside of the window and the empty columns will be filled
with spaces with an attribute of lightgray on black.  To change what
character and color to put in the new columns, determine the hex number
for the character and color you want, then put the color byte in front of
the character byte and replace the 0720h with it.  For example, to select
character $20 with a color of $04, change the 0720h to 0420h like so:

   mov [WORD PTR ds:si+2],0420h  (in scroll_right)
      or
   mov [WORD PTR ds:si-2],0420h  (in scroll_left)

these procs simply copy chunks of video memory.  One thing that might help
understand the value for bx and other stuff: the movsw copys the word from
ds:si to es:di, then if the direction flag is clear, it adds 2 to si and to
di, if the direction flag is set, it subtracts 2 from si and di.
