{
I am new to this echo, so here is my offering placed upon
the alter of exceptence. I have seen a couple of requests
for help with both scrolling the screen, as well as
reading/writting directly to/from the screen.

Here is a unit to do both. One note here, this unit is
assuming a color monitor. It can be used for a (Barrrrrfffffff)
monocrome monitor by changing the value of
"cscreen to $B000 : $0000"

If anyone has any questions, I will be monitoring this echo
from now on and will be happy to answer any questions.

       scrp = ^scr;
        scr = array[1..25,1..80] of record
                                      ch : char;
                                      at : byte;

{ SCRP : Pointer to a screen record. Used to overlay video
         memory, and so you can create dynamic screens on
         the heap.
  SCR :  An array of records that duplicates the video memory.
         You can read any position on the screen like this:
             Character_on_screen:= cscreen[y,x].ch;
         And write to a screen position like this:
          cscreen[y,x].ch:= Character_to_put_on_screen;
         And of course the color attributes would be:
            Attribute_on_screen:= cscreen[y,x].at;
}

    Var
      cscreen : scr absolute $b800 : $0000;

{ Cscreen is overlaied on video memory, so it requires ZERO bytes
  of memory. This means what is on the screen is whats in the record
  and vica/versa. What you write to the record is on the screen as
  fast as the refresh rate of your monitor.
