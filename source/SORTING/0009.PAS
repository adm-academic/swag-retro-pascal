Yes, there are lots of sorting algorithms out there! I also found this out
the hard way! :-) A couple of years ago, I only knew the so-called "bubble"
sort, and decided to create my own sorting algorithm. It would have to be
faster than bubble, yet remaining small, simple, and not memory hungry.
and I did it, but only to find out a few weeks later that there were much
better sorts than the one I created... But it sure was great fun beating
bubble! (which is brain-dead anyway! ;-)

So here it is, my two cents to the history of sorting algorithms, the
amazing, blazingly fast (*)... ELEVAtoR SorT!... Why ELEVAtoR??, you ask in
unison! Because it keeps going up & down! :-)

      a[lo + 1] := temp;

  For dummy:=1 to max do Write(data[dummy]:5,'   ');
end.

{
(*) it's speed lies somewhere between "BUBBLE" and "inSERT"; it's much
faster than "BUBBLE", and a little slower than "inSERT"... :-)
