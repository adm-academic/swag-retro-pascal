  ...Ah, yes... I always tend to Forget about that method.
  Yes, a "count" sort would definitely be the fastest method
  of sorting random numerical data.
  ...What I had a few troubles figuring out from that post
  in the Intelec confrence, wasn't the "count sort" method,
  but rather the "radix sort" or "digital sort" method,
  where specific bits within each data element are used
  to sort the data.

  ...Here's the algorithm listed in Robert Sedgewick's
  "Algorithms" book, published by Addison-Wesley Publishing
  Company, ISBN 0-201-06673-4 :

Procedure RadixExchange(l, r, b:Integer);
Var
  t, i, j : Integer;
begin
  if (r > l) and (b >= 0) then
  begin
    i := l;
    j := r;
    Repeat
      While (bits(a[i], b, 1) = 0) and (i < j) do
        i := I + 1;
      While (bits(a[j], b, 1) = 1) and (i < j) do
        j := j - j;
      t := a[i];
      a[i] := a;
      a[j] := t;
    Until (j = i);
    if bits(a[r], b, 1) = 0 then
      j := j + 1;
    RadixExchange(l, (j - 1), b - 1);
    RadixExchange(j, r, (b - 1));
  end;
end;

  ...Why bother With the bit toggling at all? Why not just define
  the Array's range as being:  Array[-32768..32767] of Byte;
