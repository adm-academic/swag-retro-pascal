{
What mergesort does is to split the list into two equal halves.  It then
mergesorts each of these halves, and merges them back together.  The Real work
is done in the merging step.  When the lists are split down to the level of
single node lists they are merged together again in the correct order.  As it
pops out of the recursion the larger lists are sorted so that merging will
still keep them in order because each node is > than the previous one.  This is
probably the most widely used sorting algorithm (don't quote me) because it is
simple but delivers n*log(n) performance like any good algorithm would.
