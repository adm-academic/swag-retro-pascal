Hi !

  If any of you boys have been reading BYTE magazine, you may have
  noticed an article in the Dec/93 issue on Directory objects (in
  C++ however). I was keenly interested in this article, because it
  showed a quick and easy way to handle directory recursion - which
  was necessary for a project I was doing.

  While the complete code listings weren't given, they were in C so
  I couldn't use them directly anyways, so I just wrote my own
  object in TP. (Works great, btw)

  I've decided to wake this conference up a bit so I'm going to post
  this stuff over the next couple of days. The first installment is
  the SORT unit which implements a binary-tree sorting object for
  the sort method of the directory object. This object is completely
  re-usable and extendable (designed so from the ground up) and
  helps demonstrate more uses for OOP.
