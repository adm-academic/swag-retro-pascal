{
    This is a Program to export a VOC or other Raw Sound File to a Parallel
port DAC.. (only For LPT1 now, but i think you can make it work on LPT2 by
changing the 'PORT[$0378]' to 'PORT[$0388]'...

 I know, This is a Real mess For figuring it out... I originally had no
intention of posting it, but I believe in free access to info, so here it is!
If you have any questions about it, just ask... and if you figure out where
that bug is (you'll know what I mean, it only plays PART of the VOC) I'd
appreciate input.
