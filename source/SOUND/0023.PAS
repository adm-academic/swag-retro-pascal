I didn't write that code, actually.  I have never written a TSR and don't plan
to in the near future, so I suggest you ask one of the gurus here.

I'm still with .90 because I can't afford to register .94 (.90 doesn't have a
registration) :-(.
Take Care, Steve

 NL> Is it possible to diable/enable the speaker output (alternatvly

The only thing that can be done is disabling the speaker many times
a second to do it.  Here's some code that disables it 18 times a second,
but notably does NOT work with programs that shut down interrupts
during playback.

{$M 1024,0,0}
{$N-,S-,G+} { Use g- for 8088 systems, g+ for V20 and above }
PROGRAM NoSpeak;
USES Dos;
VAR OLDINT1C : Procedure;

PROCEDURE ShutOff; INTERRUPT;
BEGIN
  Port [97] := Port[97] and 253; {Turn off speaker}
  OldInt1C;
  end;

BEGIN
  GetIntVec($1C, @OldInt1C);
  SetIntVec($1C, @ShutOff);
  Keep(0);
  end.

Note this is a TSR, and I can't guarantee that it'll work right on
anyone's computer.
