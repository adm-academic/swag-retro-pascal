{                                  SBTS.PAS

      This unit provides an interface to the SBTALKER (TM) Text-to-Speech
      driver.

      USAGE NOTES:
       1.  Make sure you have made SBTALKER resident, prior to running your
           application.  Call from the DOS command line:
              SBTALKER /DBLASTER

           SBTALKER.EXE and BLASTER.DRV are found on the diskettes that
           came with the Sound Blaster.
       2.  Due to the fact that this unit relies on the built-in assembler,
           you'll need Turbo Pascal, version 6.0 or later to recompile.
       3.  IMPORTANT:  Don't attempt to run an application within the
           Turbo Pascal Integrated Development Environment.  Do not launch
           it inside a software-debugger either!  It'll HANG your system.
           RUN it from the DOS command line.
