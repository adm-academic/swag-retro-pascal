Hi!

MA> 4.  I have all my GUS routines working, but can anyone point me to
MA>     a place where I can get ANY *PUBLIC DOMAIN* SB/SBPro code which
MA>     would help me play/mix digital samples?  (I'm not talking
MA>     CT-VOICE VOC code here...).
MA>
MA> As I said, ANY help would be appreciated.

Here you are! This piece of code try to show how to play digitized voices
through Sound Blaster. It's from our little SB's Programming Tutorial which
is PD, so be free to distribute it freely!
