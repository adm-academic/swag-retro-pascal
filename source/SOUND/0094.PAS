   Description: Functions and procedures to interface with the ProAudio
                Spectrum's mixer and volume controls.
   Status:      Public Domain

  This unit is a primer for programming the ProAudio Spectum basic or 16, it
doesn't seem to matter.
  IMPORTANT TECH NOTE: All settings are in percent! Just a decimal from 0 to
100. Very odd. And sometimes when you set a volume too low, it will just go
to 0. Basically what you enter will result in a volume +-2 percentage points
off what you entered. Doesn't make much difference.
  I have no idea what CrossChannels are. Or the FMSplitChips thing. They don't
seem too interesting anyhow.
  For the unknowing, mixers and volumes are basically the same thing. Setting
the output of a mixer changes it's volume if you play something that uses
that mixer. For example, a cd-rom drive is attached to the internal mixer
input. The volume functions aren't really just for volumes anyhow. They
control the treble, bass, loudness & enhanced switches too.
  Most of the procedures and functions are simple to understand. The
GetFunctionTable procedure is used internally by the unit.

  I'd like to request code re:SoundBlaster mixer/vol stuff. --}

CONST
{--volume channel select constants--}
{--These constants are used _only_ with the functions/procedures that use a
   call to functiontable.mvset(or get)volumefunction.
    VolMute is strange. It appears in the COMMON.INC file of the PAS-SDK
   but is never explained and doesn't seem to have an effect.
    VolLoudEnh is also odd. It is supposed to be used to set the Loudness
   and Enhanced switches (and it does). The only problem is that using
   a value of 100% turns _both_ on. Doing a 0% turns off only enhanced then.
   Maybe there is some trick I haven't discovered.
    VolBass & VolTreble set the Bass and Treble.
    VolLeft and VolRight are the master volume settings.
    VolMode is some sort of modal setting. No documentation in the PAS-SDK.--}

   mixer. For example, the internal connector (hooked to the cd-rom drive)

   equiptment, microphone, PCM or digital sound, the internal speaker which
   is re-routed by the pro-audio out it's speakers and the sound-blaster
   emulation mixer. I have no idea what R_ or L_IMIXER is.--}
