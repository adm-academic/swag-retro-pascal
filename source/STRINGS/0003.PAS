You will need to set up a dedicated Character by Character input routine using
ReadKey and controlling the display yourself.  After each Character is entered
examine it and determine whether or not to add a comma.  The following very
simple (and untested) routine demonstrates this.

For a better way to do such input find and download TCSEL003.* from a PDN node
near you and study the KEYINPUT Unit.  You may be able to modify it to do
exactly what you want or perhaps use it as a guide to producing your own
"bullet proof" input routine.
