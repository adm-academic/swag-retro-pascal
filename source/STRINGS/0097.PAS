   For the SWAGS...

   To the best of my knowledge this is the fastest routine for 
   up/low-casing strings in Turbo Pascal. The difference from 
   previous versions is that it uses seges for segment override 
   and within the loop it replaces loadsb and stosb with mov 
   operations. It is also independent from the segment in which 
   Source and Table are created. 
   
   If anyone finds a bug or has a suggestion, or has a faster 
   looking routine for string translations, just leave me a 
   message here. I'll benchmark the new routine against the 
   collection I have gathered already from the SWAGS and 
   elsewhere and will post the results. 

   The following benchmarking was done in a 486/DX 60 MHz using 
   Neil Rubenking's TimeTick unit while upcasing a full string 
   (255 chars) 400,000 times (100 million characters): 

   For-Do loop using TP7 UpCase() .......... 315.5 secs.
   UpperCase (Assembler classical approach)   53.9 secs. (1)
   My old TXlat3 ...........................  28.3 secs. (2)
   Translate ...............................  26.8 secs. (3)
   TXlat5 (the one in this message) ........  21.2 secs.

   (1) There are several routines using this approach in the 
       SWAGS. See also HAX 144 in PC-Techniques. 
   (2) See "St-case4.pas" in STRINGS.SWG, it contains an earlier 
       (and buggy...) version.
   (3) See "Translate upper/lower case" in STRINGS.SWG
