Interface

Type pString = ^String;
Var SpatStr:pString;

Procedure UpCaseStr(Var s:String);
{call to convert a VAR ARG string to upper case.  Don't use w/ PCHAR!}
Procedure SetSPat(Var s:String);
{call to set the pattern to test against with each following call to
 Spat.  This sets a global pointer to the given string and converts that
 string to a format that can be read optimally fast, which saves passing
 the pattern arguement to the SPat PROC via the stack, which saves many
 many clock cycles and memory R\W accesses. 'S' *must* be a string of at
 least 12 characters, or a typecast region of memory of at least 13 bytes
 formatted as a Pascal-style STRING or ugly things may happen.}
Function SPat(Var s:String):Boolean;
{tests the given VAR ARG string against the string pattern pointed to by
 the Public SpatStr global pointer.  Passing a VAR ARG takes much less
 time since only a 4-byte pointer is pushed onto the stack prior to calling
 this PROC, as opposed to a full STRING, which may be 256 bytes and would 
be
 pushed a single char at a time... yawn...}
Function UCSPat(Var s:String):Boolean;
{tests the given VAR ARG string against the string pattern pointed to by
 the Public SpatStr global pointer.  Passing a VAR ARG takes much less
 time since only a 4-byte pointer is pushed onto the stack prior to calling
 this PROC, as opposed to a full STRING, which may be 256 bytes and would 
be
 pushed a single char at a time... yawn... Works with UPCASE'd data}

Implementation

Procedure UpCaseStr(Var s:String);assembler;
{up to 15 times faster than Borland's ASM demo code}
asm Push ds;Lds si,s;Xor ch,ch;Lodsb;Mov cl,al;Jcxz @Done;Mov dx,'az';
Mov ah,'a'-'A';Mov bx,-1;@Loop: Lodsb;Cmp al,dh;Jb @Upper;Cmp al,dl;
ja @Upper;Sub al,ah;Mov [si+bx],al;@Upper: Loop @Loop;@Done: Pop ds;end;

Procedure SetSPat(Var s:String);
{I'd write this in ASM as well, but it isn't likely to enter a loop so
 speed isn't really critical, and it may be useful to edit this to alter
 the personality of the pattern matching algorhythm.}
Type str12 = String[12];
Var l,p:Word;pat:Str12;
Begin
  If s[0]=#0 then s:='*.*';
   UpCaseStr(s);p:=1;
   For l:=1 to 12 do Case s[p] of
     '*':If l=9 then Begin Dec(l);Inc(p);end else pat[l]:='?';
