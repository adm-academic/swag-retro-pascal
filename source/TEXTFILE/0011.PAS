{
³I would like to be able to read a standard ASCII Text File from disk into
³a section of memory so I would be able to call up the screen later.  How
³would I accomplish this?  I'm assuming that once I have it in memory I could
³copy the information into $B800 and so have it display on the screen.  This
³would actually be useful For an instruction screen so I could scroll one
³screenful at a time With PgDn.

Sample code For viewing Text File. Feel free to experiment With it. If you
have any questions, just ask.
