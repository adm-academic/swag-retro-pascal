1) Prepending instead of appending...
   I think you might run into some problems With this...
   To prepend a line, you must first read the entire File,
   then move to the start of the File again, Write the new Record,
   and finally Write back all the Records you first read.
   The overhead would become enormous if the File was large.

2) Fast driver For backwards reading...  Aha!
   This is the way to do it.

   Below you will find the source of a "tail" Program.
   I wrote it because I needed to check the status of some log Files,
   and I didn't want to go through the entire File every time, as the
   Files could grow quite large.

   It is currently limited to 255 Chars per line, but that
   can easily be fixed (see the Limit Const).

   Although it's not an exact solution to your problem, it will show you
   how to do "backwards" reading.

Program Tail;
{
  Shows the tailing lines of a Text File.

  Syntax: TAIL [d:\path]Filespec.ext [-<lines>]
          Default number of lines is 10.

          "TAIL Filename -20" will show the 20 last lines
