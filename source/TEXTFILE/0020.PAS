    The Type mismatch comes from the fact Mike elected to use a general
purpose Pointer Type For his Array rather than defining a new String
Pointer Type.

    Ok, you have two possible solutions to the problem. You can (A)
TypeCast every Pointer use With String() as in

   if PA[MIDDLE]^ < S

BECOMES

   if String(PA[MIDDLE]^) < S

This one is long and requires adding the Typecast to every single
comparison. Or you can (B) define a new StrPointer Type and redefine the
Array to an Array of StrPointer.

Here is a version that should work correctly. I decided to go With the
String Pointer Type since Mike Uses GetMem anyways. if he had been using
NEW() then each allocation would have been For a 255 caracter String but
since he allready Uses GetMem to request just enough to hold the String
then the new Type will pose no problems.

    Note that some additions and Modifications have also been done to
make it work. I guess Mike was pretty tired when he wrote this ;-). The
sorting routine does work as is, just as Mike stated. I also took it
upon myself to reformat it to my standards.
