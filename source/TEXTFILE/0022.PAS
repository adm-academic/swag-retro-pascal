 This adds a small Text File to a loader which simply reads through the
 data and sends it to the ANSI driver, so it's good For ANSIs or Text
 Files that will fit in one screen.

 However you could change the loader (if you know assembly) to do paUses
 or output the File to STDOUT so you can use the more-pipe (|more).
