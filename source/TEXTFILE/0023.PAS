 *** Here is a piece of code that expresses the basic concept for which
 *** you are looking.  It takes a text file (.msg) you supply and performs
 *** an extremely simple encription on it and attaches a display method
 *** and a password you supply.  It then makes a .COM file that displays
 *** the file contents once you enter the correct password.
 *** The code is very inefficient, but written that way to show the method
 *** used to write the ASM code to the file. A better way to do this would
 *** be to place your standard ASM code in an array and increment a
 *** pointer to each command as you write it to the disk.  Let me know if
 *** you want to see a rewrite.
