  I have been exploring a faster way to read lines from text
   files. This one seems to be 30% faster than readln even with
   a full settextbuffer of $FFFF. However, it only works for
   files smaller than 64K ($FFF1) and all lines, including the
   last one, must end in the CR/LF word (readln recognizes the
   EOF (01Ah) char also as an end of line). Please repost any
   improvements. }
