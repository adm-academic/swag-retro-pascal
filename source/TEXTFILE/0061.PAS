Well, I'm writing a File Viewer and it works great, except for one thing, if
you're on the last screen of the file you're viewing, and you hit Page Down...
it will go BELOW the last line and display sime High ASCii Characters... I
have tried many things to get this to work... but it won't.. 
If SWAG wants this, they can have it...
