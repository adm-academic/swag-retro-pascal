{
  Since it looks like things are moving quite slowly here, I thought I'd
post a text viewer that I wrote. Actually, A guy named Jon Merkel
posted the original code that showed me how to smoothly scroll text. I
just modified it to read files and keep track of where in the file it's
at and stuff. I was going to make it read straight binary files so it
would display all those extended ascii characters, but I figured it'd
be a lot easier this way.
    Basically, it just reads the file 102 lines at a time. It starts out
by filling the video memory with 204 lines of text and then updates it
as needed. I guess there really isn't a fliesize limit.. Actually there
would be   ummm  FilePs is a longint so it'd be 2147483647*80. Well,
by the time you got that size file, it'd take a couple years to scroll
becuase my method of seeking a text file leaves MUCH to be desired!
    Please modify this and make it faster! I didn't spend much time on it,
and if i worked on it again, I'd probably load more than 204 lines of the
file into some temp array and then just use MOVE to transfer that data
to video memory.
    Anyways, do what you wish, but please don't dis me for bad code becuase
as I said, I didn't spend much time on this.. just thought you'd all like
to see it.. Enjoy!
 BTW, I already posted this in the FIDO pascal echo.
