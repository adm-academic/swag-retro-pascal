 { Instructions:  put your code fragment into a short routine called Segment.
   It should leave the stack unchanged, or it'll blow up when we clone it.
   It *must* have a far return at the end.  Play around with declaring it
   as an assembler procedure or not to see the cost of the TP entry and
   exit code. }
