I never posted it as a Unit.  I just posted a couple routines to set the
timer.  They're actually a part of another, larger project I've been working
on to play digitized Sound out of several different output devices.  When I
was asked if it were possible to speed up the tick and still have Dos's timer
Function behave normally, I threw them into a Unit and wrote the Program you
quoted from to illustrate how it would be done.  Here are the timer routines
as a Unit:

The routines perform no error checking on input values, so be careful
with them.  The Procedure Set8253Channel should never have a
channel value of more than 2 since the 8253 only has 3 channels
(0 - 2).
