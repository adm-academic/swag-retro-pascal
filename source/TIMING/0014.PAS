{       SIMPLE TIMER 1.0
        =================

 This is a Timer unit, it calculates time by system clock.  A few limitations
 are:

   1) Must not modify clock.
   2) Must not time more than a day
   3) Must StopTimer before displaying Time

   Usage:

      StartTimer;   Starts Timer
      StopTimer;    Stops Timer
      CalcTimer;    Calculates time
      DispTime:     Displays time between StartTimer and StopTimer,
                    you don't need to call CalcTimer if you call DispTime.

   1) The program is a DECENT program, no "Adult" or "XXX" type programs
      shall lawfully contain any code found within this file (modified or

This is a unit that I wrote.  It will not change day without calling an error
in itself.  This can be modified though, I just haven't went about doing it.
For example, if you started the timer at 11:29 pm and stopped it at 1:00 am, it
wouldn't work, but if you started the timer at 12:00 am and stopped it at 11:59
pm in that same day it would work.  The TimeStruct type doesn't store day, just
time and the only thing you have to do to use it is:

In your main program:
}
Program MyProg;

Uses
  Timer;

Begin
{ Program stuff.... }
StartTimer;
{ More Program Stuff... }
StopTimer;
{ If you don't want to display the time to the screen, then you need to
  call CalcTimer, so that it modifies TimeT}
DispTime; {Whenever you want to display the time..  The calculated time is
stored in the record variable Timer.TimeT, if you wanted to access    it.  All
the fields of the record a word in type.  To access the hours for example,
you'd go like:

                Timer.TimeT.Hour    or    TimeT.Hour

           You probably will have to try both.}
End.
