FastWait               Copyright (c) 1991  Southern Software

Version 1.00 - 4/8/91

Allows PC's faster than 20 mhz (386/486) to properly use a delay
function based upon a null looping procedure such as is used in the
Turbo Pascal "Delay" procedure.  Wait is accurate for PC's as fast as
1,100 mhz equivalent!

USAGE: Simply place "FastWait" in the Uses section of your program
       and replace each occurrence of "delay" in your program with
       "wait".

Example-
=======

     Existing program:
     ----------------
     Uses CRT;

     begin
     writeln('This program delays for 5 seconds.);
     delay(5000);
     end.

     New program:
     -----------
     Uses FastWait, CRT;                {Now also uses "FastWait"}

     begin
     writeln('This program delays for 5 seconds.);
     wait(5000);                        {changed "delay" to "wait"}
     end.

                    The variable "LoopsPerTick" has the number of loops
                    to do for one BIOS tick (18.2 of these/sec). If you
                    want to delay for "X" æs, the number of loops required
                    would be  "(LoopsPerTick * X) div 54945". This will not
                    compile if you are using TP 4.0, 5.0 or 5.5 due to the
                    conditional defines. This is because it makes use of
                    the "asm" statement which is not available in TP
                    versions prior to 6.0. *)
