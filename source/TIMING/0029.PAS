sounds like you mite be running under windoz ?
Delay will malfunction at times if a multitasker or you have
redirected some interrupts for background events.. like the iNT $08
for example..
I not sure how TP 7.0 does it but TP 6.0 uses a software loop..
you could use the timer 2 for a delay if you not use sound at the time.
if you use the PC speaker then poll timer 0..  it you leave timer 0 set
to its standard then its simple.

procedure HardWareDelay( Time :word); { time in Millisecs }
Var
 CompVar, LastReading:Word;
 Begin
   CompVar := (Time / 0.00000083);
 asm
  CLI;
  Mov AL, $36;
  out $43, AL;
  in AL , $40;
  Mov Byte Ptr LastReading, AL;
  In AL, $40;
  Mov Byte Ptr lastReading+1, AL;
 @L:
  CLI;
  Mov AL, $36;
  out $43, AL;
  in AL, $40;
  Mov BL, AL;
  in Al, $40;
  STI;
  Mov BH, Al;
  Mov AX, lastReading;
  Sub BX, AX;
  Cmp BX, CompVar
  Jb @l;

 End;
