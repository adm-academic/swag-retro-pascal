{I have made some changes in your Unit Check, in order to make ik a bit faster
and use somewhat less code and data space (61 Bytes in all). Also, the display
of progress on screen is now 'ticking' because I swap the colors from white on
blue to gray on blue (perhaps a nice idea, now you can see if the machine
Really crashed)...

  Data size:  32 Bytes   30 Bytes   2 Bytes

  Here is the $1C ISR that I will add (unless you wish to do that).

  Some changes were made, which resulted in less code and data size, a
  little more speed, and display of the progress Variable on screen is
  made 'ticking' each second by changing the colour from white on blue
  to gray on blue and back With each update.
