Have a look at the following. With some amendments it will do what you want.

To excute the program, dpmitsr.exe has to be executed before starting Windows.
Dpmitsr will remain permanently in memory.

Both DPMITSR.ASM and DPMIWIN.PAS were nicely running programs in early 1992
with TPW. Now, under BPW an error is reported from the SYSTEM unit.
However, as I now don't have the time to trace the error herewith the programs,
as it will surely point the way for you to go.
