Well, I hope mine worked decently...it just didn't mod the current
cursor position.

Good...I'm glad you understand this.  I don't have TSR_TPU, but I do
have some source that shows how to detect if a TSR is already loaded and
how to unload a TSR.  The hotkey part you can do your self.  You can
put in this program like the one I have below which will tell you what values
to look for in Port[$60] for keypresses.  Just run it, and hit your key combo.
For example, if you wanted ALT-A, you'd run this, and hit ALT-A, and you'd
see it would exit with 30 on the screen.  So in your TSR, you say:
If Port[$60]=30 then...
See?  If you want the uninstall/detect TSR program, please tell me...
