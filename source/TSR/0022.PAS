Marek:

The features to which you refer constitute writing a TSR program.
These programs are executed and terminate, but stay resident in
system memory.  Prior to termination they insert themselves into
the Interrupt Service Routine chain of a known interrupt vector.

This programming was simplified somewhat in turbo Pascal Release
4 or 5 with the addition of the Keep, GetIntVec and SetIntVec
procedures of the DOS unit.  However, these procedures are only
a small fraction of the coding needed to write reliable TSR's.
This fact explains the lack of simple code examples.

To write good TSR's you need to read about them and play with
someone else's code for a while. (I've coded pascal for 17 years,
but my first TSR took about 3 days to debug).  For a solid
Pascal reference, try Tom Swan's 'Mastering Turbo Pascal'.
To figure out what the interrupt functions are doing, I recommend
Ralf Brown's & Jim Kyle's 'PC Interrupts'.  The book is derived
from their well-known interrupt list (INTERnn.ZIP) available
on many programming oriented BBS systems.  The index of the book
is well worth the money.  Finally, I recommend Ed Mitchell's
"Borland Pascal Developer's Guide". Ed's TSR code is thorough
and documented with education in mind.  Since I'm quoting
ED's book here, please buy a copy if you find the code useful.

Good luck

{ TSR.PAS
  Sample TSR application written in Turbo Pascal.
  IMPORTANT!
  This TSR operates only in TEXT mode, and, as
  written, supports only 80 x 25 sized screens
  (not 43- or 50- line display modes).

  This TSR will only operate on DOS 3.x or newer
  versions of DOS.

  Use this code as an example to write your own TSR code.
  Modify the $M compiler directive, below, to specify
  the maximum stack size, minimum heap and maximum heap
  required for your TSR application.

  Please see the text and other source comments
  for important restrictions.

  TSRs can be DANGEROUS, so be careful.

This handler is enabled only while the TSR is popped
up on-screen.

This handler exists solely to catch any DOS
critical errors and is a crude method of doing so. Since
this routine does nothing, any critical errors that
occur while the TSR is popped up are ignored--which
could be very dangerous. Also, if another TSR or ISR
pops up after this one, it may get the critical
error that was intended for this TSR.
NOTE: Normally, this could be an "interrupt" type
procedure. However, Turbo Pascal pushes and then pops
all registers prior to the IRET instruction. By writing
this as an assembler routine, this generates the IRET
directly, followed by one superfluous RET instruction
generated by the assembler, resulting in substantial
code savings.

idea is that when applications are doing nothing except

repeatedly. INT 28 runs through a chain of applications
that each get a crack at running.

The keyboard interrupt handler watches for the
magic TSR popup key. Some of the time it runs the TSR
popup directly; when DOS is doing something, however, it
can't run the TSR. So, it sets a flag saying "Hey, INT
28, if you see this flag set, then do the TSR." So the
INT 28 code, here, examines the flag. If the flag is set, INT 28
knows that the TSR was activated, so it calls it now.
We can do this because DOS calls INT 28 only if it's safe
for something else to run.
