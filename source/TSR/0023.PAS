Hmm ... My initial attempt was to disable the Int 19h handler, which is
called when you hit ctrl-alt-del; but it didn't work.  So here's a TSR
that "cheats": if you hit "ctrl" and "alt" and then "del", it flags
"ctrl" and "alt" as "not down" and so your system never sees the reboot
condition. }

uses dos;

const ctrlbyte = $04;  { Memory location $0040:$0017 governs the statuses of }
      altbyte  = $08;  { the Ctrl key, Alt, Shifts, etc.  the "$04" bit }
                       { handles "Ctrl"; "$08" handles "Alt". }

var old09h: procedure;                          { original keyboard handler }
    ctrldown, altdown, deldown: boolean;
    keyboardstat: byte absolute $0040:$0017;    { the aforementioned location }

                                "undepressed".  Then it calls the
