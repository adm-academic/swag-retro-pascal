Well, here it is, a program that lists TSRs loaded.
Anybody willing to enhance it so that it checks the HMA for TSRs too?

Oh, were do I send this so that it gets into the next SWAGS release?  I was
unable to find such a program in the all the SWAGS until (and inclusive) the
latest February '94 release...

        (null-terminated) strings.  Two consecutive null (0) bytes mean that
        the environment variables have ended and the program name follows
        after 4 bytes.  That is also an ASCIIZ string.

  {
    Note: The last MCB is not processed!
          It is assumed that it is this program's MCB.
          In your programs, this may or may not be the case.
