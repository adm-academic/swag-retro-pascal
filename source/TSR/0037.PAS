Hmmm... Well.... have a look at this code, it is a part from my TSR, I have
marked the procedures that are just for my TSR, and have made a seperate
function in the new interrupt to unload the TSR.  The unload part is written
in July 94 by Luis Mezquita Raya.  It seems to work :)
It is a TSR player for HSC files (by Chicken yep).

I left out the VAR part, but I guess you are smart enough to reconstruct that
one...  Anyway, it seems to work perfectely at my side, so...
