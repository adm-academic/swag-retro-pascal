{
I love it when people actually post there hard slaved code. I've
seen a number of people wanting to write tsr's, and all the examples
in BP that I've ever come across are pathetic and above 6K of mem!
So for those serious here is some flexible and easy to use code.
Drowning in comments ;-) It's extremely efficient on memory (1040)
bytes! I  can write it in pascal using 550 bytes put then I decided
to make it user friendly to a degree ;-) Shout if you need to know
more info on tsr writing eg. making it be polite to dos etc ;-))
