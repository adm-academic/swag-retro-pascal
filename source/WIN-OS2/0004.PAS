{
 I am writing a Dos based Program in Turbo Pascal 6.0 that Uses a
 GUI Interface. My problem is that I would like to be able to import
 Windows or OS/2 icons to use instead of making my own. Does anyone
 know the File Format For either of these Files or better yet have
 source code For displaying them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The following code is a Unit I wrote to handle Windows icon Files. I
don't have the code yet For OS/2 icon Files, although I believe they are
quite similar. As Far as displaying the icons, just pass a Pointer
to the icon to your Graphics routines and let them decode and display
the structures. You should also be able to use a subset of the
structures to decode icons embedded in Windows .EXE Files.

At offset $24 in the "new executable" header For Windows and OS/2 .EXE
Files is a Word Variable that specifies an additional offset to the
resource table.
