Rebooting in itself is rather easy to do...call the right interrupt with
the right values and you go it--most of the time.  I'd noticed that any
reboot I tried to do from my program under windows would fail.  I'm not a
windows programmer and seldom use it, but I do have one program that needs
to be able to call this routine under certain conditions.  A clean reboot
is favored to a lock up or data corruption.  I searched for pascal source
to work under win, but found none.  I finally ran into a short .com file
which did in fact work.  I ran the code through a .com to pas inline
conversion utility and ended up with pages of ugly code.  I finally got
around to converting it into inline assembly code which shortened things up
substantially (10 pages or so-the inline tranlsation was bad, loops were
iterative/non existant).  I then killed the code not necessary for pascal,
and this is what I ended up with:
