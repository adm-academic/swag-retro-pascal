{
        Useful for transferring  objects which have been registered to the clipboard or any global memory situation.
        Also could be used to make a copy of any streamable object. Merely stream the object to memory and then
        re-instantiate a new object through the use of a TStream.Get. Solves the
        problem of passing objects to another program because it removes any method pointer info.

        NOTE: This works only for streams which are not larger than 64K. In order
                                to make this work for larger streams you have to ensure that your
                                writes and puts (and gets and reads...) don't straddle each 64K boundary.
                                I haven't added the pointer math to this unit yet.

 object is disposed of. Sometime you don't want to delete the block if for
 example it has been placed in the clipboard or passed using DDE.
