I'm assuming you have a DC already off screen that you can blit from?
You can draw to it too. Just like a normal DC. I'm worrying now that I
don't quite understand either your problem or just what your code looks
like.

 Ka> Many thanks for your help.

Hey, it's late, I'll see what I can write...there didn't take long. I
was able to draw rectangles off screen and blit them to the main window.
You ought to be able to do whatever drawing function you want. I took
some short cuts regarding colour depth and bitmap size (hard coding
rules OK!)
