How about if I post this test code that somebody wanted a few days ago.
It has no interaction and doesn't bother to make use of the timer or
anything in the draw loop, but it's a quick draw loop. You can set up
timers and i/o responses as you see fit. Right off though, just having a
window to draw in is a good start. It's how I started...

 it's small and useless and stupid and somebody
 might find it useful, so I release this program
